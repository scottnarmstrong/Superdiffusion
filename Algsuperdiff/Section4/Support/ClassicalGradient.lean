# The classical `C¹` carrier, Support-layer home

The queued cleanup is DONE: the provider's duplicate copies were deleted and
`AffineSplitLift.lean` now imports this module, so `slope, `slope and
`HasGradientOn` have exactly one home and no `Iff.rfl` conversion is needed
anywhere.

/-- **`f` is differentiable on `W` with gradient field `G`.**  This is the
classical `C¹` half of the source hypothesis `h ∈ C^{1,1/2}(□_m)`, written
against `Vec d`'s sup-norm through `slopeCLM`. -/

/-- `HasGradientOn` is antitone in the window: the Fréchet derivative within a set
restricts to any subset.  Consolidated here  from the two identically named
provider copies in `Provider/ExcessDecay/OneStepAssembly.lean` and
`Provider/ExcessDecay/BoundaryAssemblyTransport.lean`, so that dot notation
`h.mono_set hsub` keeps working on the single Support-layer carrier. -/
