# `r`-dependence of the annular per-scale atoms

ABK26 applies Proposition `p.concentration` to the per-scale annular atoms three
times, each time through the sentence "since the sequence `{X_j}` is
`2`-dependent".  The abstract hypothesis is
`Algsuperdiff.Probability.RDependent`; the geometry is
`AnnulusSeparation.separatedBy_annulusRegion_of_gap`; the probability is
`ShellActiveSigma.iIndepFun_of_local_cutoffSample`.  This module is the one
bridge that joins them, and nothing else.

## The statement

`rDependent_of_annulusLocalSigma`: if every `X n` is measurable for the single
sigma-field `cutoffSampleLocalSigma M (n − c) (annulusRegion d n)` — i.e. `X n`
reads only truncations at or below level `n − c`, and only on the annulus of its
own index — then `X` is `r`-dependent for every `r ≥ 1` with
`3 + 2·3^{1−c}·√d ≤ 3^r`.

The truncation offset `c` and the count `r` are **free**.

## Who supplies the hypothesis

`hX` is exactly the `hloc` slot the proved `𝒢₂` lane already discharges:

* `Provider.Proportion.G2Locality.measurable_Xcal_annulusRegion_local` — the
  §4.1 atom `X_j` at `c = 2`;
* `Provider.Proportion.G2Locality.measurable_errorAnnMax_annulusRegion_local` —
  its per-inner-scale summand, same offset;

## Main results

* `rDependent_of_annulusLocalSigma` — the bridge, free `c` and free `r`.

## References

* ABK26, `p.concentration`.
* ABK26, `l.minimal.scale.sep`, Step 1 (the separation claim).

/-! ## The bridge -/

/-- **The `r`-dependence of the annular atoms.**  A family `X : ℤ → Ω → ℝ` on the
genuine cutoff carrier, each member of which reads only truncations at or below
its own level `n − c` and only on the annulus `annulusRegion d n` of its own
index, is `r`-dependent for the cutoff law, for every `r ≥ 1` with
`3 + 2·3^{1−c}·√d ≤ 3^r`.

The proof is the composition of the two proved halves: the finite set of
pairwise `≥ r`-separated indices carried is turned into the pairwise geometric
separation `separatedBy_annulusRegion_of_gap` at the shared-shell threshold `√d
· 3^{min (n−c) (n'−c)}`, which is verbatim the `hsep` hypothesis of
`iIndepFun_of_local_cutoffSample` at `Lidx n = n − c`. -/
