# Theorem B, §4.5: two range transfers for the real defect witness

## What this module is

The frozen root asks for a **real-valued** `E_B: Ω → ℝ` with

```text
  0 ≤ E_B,   E_B measurable,
  ∫⁻ (ofReal E_B)^p ≤ ( C (√p + √|log γ|) √γ (log γ)² )^p
      for every p ∈ [1, C⁻¹ γ⁻¹ |log γ|⁻¹].
```

This repository's carrier `EthmB(m)` is `[0,∞]`-valued
(`HomStepEnvelope.ethmB`), so the real cut needs `EthmB < ∞` a.e., and the cut
is then made at

```text
  E_B(ω):= K · (EthmB(m)(ω)).toReal,
```

with `K` the Step-3/Step-4 absorption factor (the constant the manuscript
"absorbs into `EthmB(m)`"), carried as a parameter and paid for in the
constant `C`.

Two elementary transfers about the `p`-range are what that construction needs
from this file, and they are all it contains:

* `range_mono_of_le` — a `p`-range stated at the larger constant is contained
  in the `p`-range stated at the smaller one, so the root's own range
  `p ≤ C⁻¹γ⁻¹|log γ|⁻¹` implies every sub-range the chain reads;
* `gamma_mul_absLog_le` — `γ|log γ| ≤ 4√γ` on `0 < γ < 1`, the only place a
  logarithm meets a power of `γ` here.  It is spent exactly once, to put
  `p = 1` inside the range, which is where the a.e. finiteness of the `[0,∞]`
  carrier comes from.

/-- `γ|log γ| ≤ 4√γ` on `0 < γ < 1`: the `absLog_mul_sqrt_le` multiplied by
`√γ` and collapsed with `t³ ≤ t²` at `t = γ^{1/4} ≤ 1`.  This is the only place
a logarithm meets a power of `γ` in this module; it is spent exactly once, to
put `p = 1` inside the theorem's own range. -/
