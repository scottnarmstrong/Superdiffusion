# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 3c: the chain endpoint with NO representative binder

## What this module is

`HomSpineRepLimit` produces a continuous representative from the negative-order
gauge alone.  This module wires that producer into the two places the
chain assumed one:

* `HasContinuousRepresentative` — the residue predicate — is now a THEOREM
  under the gauge (`hasContinuousRepresentative_of_uniformBoxGauge`);
* the finite-`p` `L^∞` conversion — whose three binders `hgc`,
  `hgw`, `hzero` carried the representative and its face vanishing — is
  restated with those three binders GONE and the conclusion at the a.e.-defined
  `w` itself.

The face vanishing `hzero` is not lost: it is the derived
`faceZero_of_continuousRepresentative`, applied to the representative this
module produces.  The only new hypothesis is `hWzero` (`w` vanishes off the
open cube), which the `H¹₀` zero extension supplies and which the frame already
carries.

## The shape of the endpoint

```text
  3^{-m}|w x| ≤ 96 d² · liftGeomFactor (s + d/p) · A     for a.e. x ∈ □_m
```

— the same display as the conversion theorem, with `g` replaced by `w`.
The two agree a.e., so the restricted a.e. statement transfers verbatim; the
consumer (clause (C3)) reads `|u - v|` on the open cube, where `w` IS `u - v`.

`HasContinuousRepresentative w` — the ONE irreducible frame item of the §4.5
spine — holds under the translate-uniform negative gauge on `∇w` together with
the integrability and compact support the `H¹₀` zero extension already
supplies.  This is `HomSpineRepLimit.exists_continuous_ae_eq_of_uniformBoxGauge`
