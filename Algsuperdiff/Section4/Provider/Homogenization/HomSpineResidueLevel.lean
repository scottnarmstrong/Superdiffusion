# `hlevel` and `hlevelDual` with the `EthmB(m)` pairing DISCHARGED

## What this file supplies

The installed `hlevel` and its dual carry three
content-bearing hypotheses: the Theorem-C energy bound `hSbound`, and the pair
`hA`/`hB` together with the budget split `hsplit`.  This file DISCHARGES the
second group at the concrete substitution against the two summands of
`EthmB(m)`:

* the defect witness is cut at `E_B:= (EthmB(m))(ω).toReal` — the same cut
  `HomSpineFinalWitness` makes for the root's clause (C2);
* `C_w` is the explicit sum of the four pairing constants (two per level
  condition), none of which carries randomness;
* `hA`, `hB` are then `le_rfl` — the slots ARE the pairing's left-hand sides —
  and `hsplit` is the budget split.

What remains of the two level conditions is:

```text
  hSbound  (Theorem C's Step-2 energy density, at the printed constant shape)
  hdom1, hdom2  (the carrier seam — see `HomSpineResiduePairing`'s disclosure)
  hfin  (a.e. finiteness of the [0,∞] carrier: HomSpineFinalWitness's own step)
```

That pairing constant is bounded by the bundle's `K_abs` slot as a frame
condition, not proved here: `K_abs` is a free parameter of the endpoint.
