# Theorem B, §4.5: THE SPINE — the frozen root's conclusion body

```text
  ∃ γ₀ C, 0 < γ₀ ∧ 0 < C ∧ ∀ M, c⋆(M) = c⋆ → γ ≤ γ₀ → ∀ m,
    ∃ σ̄_m, 0 < σ̄_m ∧ (C1) ∧
      ∃ E_B, (0 ≤ E_B) ∧ Measurable E_B ∧ (C2) ∧
        ∀ᵐ ω, ∀ L ≥ m, ∀ u v h g K_g K_h K_h^∞, (five binders) → (C3) ∧ (C4).
```

## What is DISCHARGED here, and what is supplied

* **(C1)** — the `σ̄_m` closeness display: supplied at the constant `C_flow`
  and re-based to the endpoint's own `C = C_wit + C_flow`.  This is Section 3's
  `diffusivity_asymptotics` (`Frozen/Section3/DiffusivityAsymptotics.lean`) read
  at `σ̄_m = Annealed.sigmaBar M m`; the endpoint is stated for an ARBITRARY
  `σ̄_m` satisfying it, so the Section-3 anchor plugs in unchanged, and so does
  the trivial witness `σ̄_m = √(ν² + c⋆γ⁻¹3^{2γm})` (for which the display holds
  at every `C ≥ 0`).  Nothing about `σ̄_m` is assumed beyond positivity and that
  one display.
* **(C2)** — the real cut `E_B = K·(EthmB(m)).toReal`, its measurability, its
  moment at the root's own constant shape and `p`-range.  Its own single edge is
  `hY`.
* **(C3), (C4)** — supplied per `ω` by the clause supplier, at the
  `EthmB(m)`-domination interface: the producer exhibits a REAL defect `D` with
  `ofReal D ≤ EthmB(m)(ω)` (this is the manuscript's "comparing to the
  definition of `EthmB(m)`") and the two printed displays at `K·D`.
  The endpoint converts `K·D` into `E_B(ω)` through the witness's linkage —
  which is where the a.e. finiteness of the `[0,∞]` carrier is spent — and
  produces the root's clause bodies verbatim.

## The data-bracket nonnegativity, derived (not assumed)

The `stepFourEnergyEndpoint` carries `0 ≤ dataBracket …` as a binder.  Here it
is PROVED from the root's own five binders: `□_m` contains two distinct points
(`exists_ne_pair_openCubeSet`), so `HolderSeminormBoundOn.nonneg` gives `0 ≤
K_g` and `0 ≤ K_h`, and the sup binder at the cube centre gives `0 ≤ K_h^∞`.
No frame item is left on the data side.

## The conditional set of the spine endpoint, itemized

1. `hY` — the Theorem-C minimal-scale exponential moment (`hC`), exactly the
   edge, at the abstract `[0,∞]` carrier.  See `HomSpineFinalWitness` for the
   blocked composition with the `homY_moment_bound_of_gamma_le` (a NAME
   COLLISION in the tree, reported there).
2. `hC1` — the `σ̄_m` closeness display (Section 3's own anchor, or the trivial
   witness).
3. `hclauses` — the per-`ω` clause supplier.  `HomSpineFinalStepFour`'s
   `exists_comparator_stepFourEnergy` produces its (C4) half from ONE `hCG'`
   application and the Schauder external; its (C3) half is the
   `L^∞` conversion at the same `hCG'`.  What is NOT bridged here is
   the comparator quantifier (`∃ v` produced by the Schauder package versus the
   root's `∀ v`) and the `hlevel`/`hS` arithmetic that consumes `hC`'s display;
   both are itemized in this file.
