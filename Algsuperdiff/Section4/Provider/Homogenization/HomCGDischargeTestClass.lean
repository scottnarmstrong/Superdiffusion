# The two printed levels, and the ONE residue between them and `WeakNegDualBoundOn`

## The two legs, at the printed levels

`HomCGDischargeAssembly` proves the printed display as a single inequality for
the pair `σ₀‖∇u-∇v‖ + ‖𝐚∇u-σ₀∇v‖`.  `smoothDual_legs_of_display` splits it into
the two levels the Step-4 consumer wants, which are the two levels exactly:

```text
  σ₀ · ‖∇u-∇v‖_{smooth dual}  ≤  3^{sm} · RHS,
       ‖𝐚∇u-σ₀∇v‖_{smooth dual} ≤  3^{sm} · RHS.
```

## The residue: the TEST CLASS, isolated as one `Prop`

`WeakNegDualBoundOn Q s W F` (the carrier, consumed at Step 4) quantifies over
**merely Hölder** test fields, measured in the volume-normalized Hölder gauge
`wsInftyGauge Q s Ksup KHol = 3^{-s·scale}·Ksup + KHol`.  `CoarseGraining`'s
dual quantifies over **globally smooth** test fields measured in
`cubeEuclideanWspFullENorm` at the conjugate exponent.  The domination of the
Hölder test gauge by the smooth-dual gauge is exactly the missing comparison,
and it is the ONLY missing thing: given it, every smooth-dual level converts to
a `WeakNegDualBoundOn` level at one uniform factor `Ktest`.

## MEASUREMENT: the conversion is FALSE at equal orders

That domination must fail when `s` is read on both sides.
The reason is an index obstruction, not a constant:

* the Hölder gauge is the `B^{s}_{∞,∞}(□_m)` norm (the manuscript declares
  `C̲^{0,s}` and `W̲^{s,∞}` interchangeable);
* `CoarseGraining`'s test gauge is the Gagliardo `W^{s,p′}` norm, i.e. `B^{s}_{p′,p′}`;
* on a bounded cube `B^{s}_{∞,∞} ⊂ B^{s}_{p′,∞}` but `B^{s}_{p′,∞} ⊄ B^{s}_{p′,p′}`:
  the Gagliardo double integral of a `C^{0,s}` field carries the integrand
  `|x-y|^{-s p′ - d}·|φ(x)-φ(y)|^{p′} ≤ K^{p′}|x-y|^{-d}`, which is
  **logarithmically divergent**, and the bound is saturated by Weierstrass-type
  fields.  So no finite `Ktest` exists at equal orders.

The honest route therefore LOSES ORDER: apply the display at `s′ < s`,
where `C^{0,s}(□_m) ⊂ W^{s′,p′}(□_m)` holds with constant
`C(d,(s-s′)p′)^{1/p′}·3^{m(s-s′)}`, and observe that the same `3^{m(s-s′)}`
appears in the `L^{p′}` half of the gauge, so it factors out of the whole
comparison:

```text
  ‖φ‖_{W^{s′,p′} full} ≤ C · 3^{m(s-s′)} · wsInftyGauge □_m s Ksup KHol.
```

Composed with the display at `s′` (whose smooth-dual level carries `3^{s′m}`)
this produces exactly the target level `3^{sm}`, i.e. the order loss is FREE at
the level, and is paid only inside the right-hand side, where the printed
`s^{-1}`, `s^{-9/2}` and `(s₂-s)^{-1}` are evaluated at `s′` instead of `s`.
Because the spine's bundle quantifies `s`, `s₂`, `C_cg`, `E₁`, `E₂`, `D_g` and
`S` **existentially**, that substitution is admissible for the spine; it is NOT
admissible inside a single instance of the transcribed finite-`p`
coarse-graining hypothesis, whose three clauses share one `s`.

## The two analytic inputs the order-loss route still needs

Neither was found by name or statement search in `CoarseGraining`, in this
repository, or in the Mathlib `MeasureTheory`/`SpecialFunctions` integrability
files:

1. `∫∫_{□×□} |x-y|^{β-d} dx dy < ∞` for `β > 0` with the explicit cube-scaling
   `≤ C(d,β)·|□|·L^{β}` — the Riesz-kernel integrability that turns a Hölder
   bound into a Gagliardo bound.  The nearest available statement is `CoarseGraining`'s
   `rieszKernel_integrableOn_ball`, which is the SINGLE exponent `β = 1`
   (`‖x-y‖^{1-d}`); the route needs `β = (s-s′)p′`, which is small — and
   `β = 1` would force `s′ = s - 1/p′ < 0` under the bundle's own guard
   `s + d/p ≤ 1/2`, so the available case cannot be reused;
2. a smooth-test approximation: a `C^{0,s}` field on `□_m` is the uniform limit
   on `□_m` of globally smooth fields with the same sup and Hölder bounds
   (McShane extension + mollification; the `mollifyBump` machinery
   and the Hölder preservation cover the mollification half).

The domination at equal orders is what those two inputs would produce.
