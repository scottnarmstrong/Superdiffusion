# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 3c: the continuous representative, PRODUCED

## What this module is

The §4.5 spine has ONE irreducible frame item: the
existence of a continuous representative of the `H¹₀` zero extension of `u -
v`.  The print obtains it in the paper by citing `u - v ∈ H¹₀(□_m)`, which for
`d ≥ 2` does not supply one; the correction records the gap and the suggested
print correction.  This module carries it out:

```text
  (a)  w ⋆ ψ_k → w   a.e.                      (ae_tendsto_convolution_mollifyBump)
  (b)  each w ⋆ ψ_k is (1-s, 16 d A)-Hölder     (the mollifier chain, ψ-uniform)
  (c)  (a) + (b)  ⟹  w has a continuous representative
```

Step (a) is Mathlib's
`ContDiffBump.ae_convolution_tendsto_right_of_locallyIntegrable`; its ratio
hypothesis `rOut ≤ K · rIn` holds for the `mollifyBump` at `K = 2` EXACTLY
(`rOut = 1/(k+1)`, `rIn = 1/(2(k+1))`).  Step (b) is the
`holderSeminormBoundOn_convolution_of_uniformBoxGauge`, whose constant does not
depend on the mollifier.  Step (c) is the scalar precise-representative lemma
`exists_continuous_ae_eq_of_uniformHolderBall` proved here.

### Why (c) needs no compactness

The classical route is Arzelà–Ascoli on the closure of the cube.  It is not
needed: a co-null set is DENSE, and equicontinuity transports the Cauchy
property from a dense set to EVERY point,

```text
  |f_k x - f_j x| ≤ 2 K ‖x - z‖^α + |f_k z - f_j z|,
```

so `(f_k x)` is Cauchy at every `x` and the pointwise limit `g` exists
everywhere.  `g` is then Hölder on every ball of radius `r` by the
`holderSeminormBoundOn_of_tendsto`, hence continuous; and `g = w` wherever the
a.e. convergence holds, hence a.e.  No covering, no compactness, no
completeness beyond that of `ℝ`.

## Main results

* `ae_tendsto_convolution_mollifyBump` — step (a), the a.e. mollifier limit;
* `exists_continuous_ae_eq_of_uniformHolderBall` — step (c), the scalar
  precise representative from a uniformly Hölder, a.e.-convergent family;
* `exists_continuous_ae_eq_of_uniformBoxGauge` — **THE PRODUCER**: the
  continuous representative from the negative-order gauge on `∇w` plus local
  integrability and compact support ALONE.  No representative is assumed.

/-- **The a.e. mollification limit.**

For an integrable scalar, the mollifications along the shrinking bump family
converge almost everywhere.  This is Mathlib's Lebesgue-point statement; the
only repository-specific input is the radius ratio, which for `mollifyBump` is
`rOut = 2 · rIn` exactly, so the hypothesis holds at `K = 2` with no slack. -/

/-! ## 3. The scalar precise representative -/

/-- **THE SCALAR PRECISE REPRESENTATIVE.**

A family of scalars that is uniformly Hölder — one exponent `α > 0`, one
constant `K`, on every closed ball of one fixed radius `r > 0` — and converges
almost everywhere has a CONTINUOUS limit, defined at every point, which is an
everywhere-defined representative of the a.e. limit.

The proof is the equicontinuity transport described in the module docstring:
the convergence set is co-null, hence dense; the Hölder bound turns density
into the Cauchy property at every point; `ℝ` is complete. -/

/-! ## 4. The producer -/

/-- **THE PRODUCER — the continuous representative from the gauge alone.**

From the translate-uniform negative gauge of order `-s` on `∇w`, together with
the frame items the chain already needs (`w` weakly differentiable on `Vec d`,
integrable, compactly supported, gradient coordinates integrable), the scalar
`w` HAS a continuous representative.  Nothing about a representative is
assumed: this is the step the manuscript obtains by citing `H¹₀` membership,
which does not supply it.

The radius is `r = 3^m / 2`, so that a closed `r`-ball has diameter at most
`3^m` and the `ψ`-uniform Hölder bound applies on it with constant `16 d A`. -/
