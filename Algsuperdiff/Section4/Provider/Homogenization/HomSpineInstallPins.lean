# The INSTALLED bundle: the four dominations discharged at the printed carriers

## What this file supplies

The re-cut bundle's four slot dominations are PINNABLE but were not
INSTALLED.  This file installs them: the §4.5 bundle core is
`HomSpineRecutClose`'s re-cut bundle with

* the abstract slots `Ccg, 𝓔₁, 𝓔₂, D_g` REPLACED by the printed carriers' own
  `toReal` (`recutPinnedDg` and its three siblings);
* the four dominations, the four sign conditions and the two pin equations
  DELETED — they are discharged by `HomSpineRecutSupport`'s `_dominates_self`
  corollaries at exactly those values;
* the order frame reduced to the two conditions that are not numerals: the
  bundle's own guard `s + d/p ≤ 1/2` and the window `7s/8 < s₂`.

What survives is the genuinely content-bearing core:

```text
  { the MULTISCALE clause, hS, hlevel, hlevelDual, hEB/hdom, (jn, s, Cw, S, EB, Fflux) }.
```

The installation is general in `(p, s₂)` and is instantiated at the
printed exponent `p = 4d` and the CORRECTED window pin `s₂ = 49/100`
(`HomSpineInstallData` machine-checks that the `s₂ = 3/8` cannot absorb the
forcing leg at the `γ⁵` rate and that `49/100` can).
