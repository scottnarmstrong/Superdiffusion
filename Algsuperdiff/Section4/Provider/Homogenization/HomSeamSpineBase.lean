# Theorem B, §4.5: the spine at a FREE `EthmB` base and a FREE `Y`

## Why this file exists

The authorized re-pin moves the `EthmB(m)` base exponent from the printed
`s = |log γ|⁻¹` to `s/8`, and the index change enlarges the printed `Y` slot
by two more error factors (`HomSpineTopScale.stepTwoEnlargedY`).  Both moves are
INSIDE the own carrier `ethmB M Cgap Y m n sb`, and every
spine module (`HomSpineFinalWitness`, `HomSpineFinalEndpoint`) hard-codes

```text
  Y  = homMinimalScaleFactor (1 - α) X,      sb = ⟨homS M, hs⟩.
```

This file re-states that chain with `Y` and `sb` FREE, and with the single thing
those modules used them for — Step 1's moment display — taken as an explicit
hypothesis `StepOneDisplayAt`.  Nothing else changes: the real cut `E_B`, the
linkage, clauses (C1)/(C2), and the passage to the root's conclusion body are
the arguments verbatim.

## The statement

```text
  StepOneDisplayAt   — Step 1's display as a named input, at a free `(Y, sb)`.
```

`hY` does NOT appear: at a free `Y` the Theorem-C exponential moment is not a
statement about `Y` at all, and the composite it fed (`Y`'s own `2p`-moment)
lives inside `StepOneDisplayAt`, where the consumer discharges it.

Step 1's own display is exactly this `Prop` at `Y =
homMinimalScaleFactor (1-α) X` and `sb = ⟨homS M, hs⟩`; the `s/8` sibling at
the enlarged `Y` is this file.  The `p`-range is the display's own, at the
display's own constant. -/
