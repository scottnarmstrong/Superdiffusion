# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 3b: the arithmetic of the gap absorption

## The two targets

Step 3 (the coarse graining application): substitute the mesoscale energy bound
(the Step 2b) into the general coarse-graining estimate and obtain the gradient
homogenization bound.

Step 3 (the gap absorption): the mesoscale gap `s^{-9/2} 3^{(n-m)/2} ≤ C γ^5`,
substituted back, compared with the definition of `EthmB(m)`, yielding the weak
gradient bound.

## THE SECOND CONDITIONAL EDGE — disclosed

The general coarse-graining proposition is a declared dependency AND a declared
source hypothesis of the Step-3a node ("the general coarse-graining proposition
applied with `p → ∞` … substituted into the general coarse-graining estimate"),
so its conclusion enters here as a NAMED TRANSCRIBED HYPOTHESIS `hCG`, exactly
as Theorem C's display enters as `hC`.  It is **not** available as a theorem:

* the graph marks the node a BOUNDARY LEAF (Section 2, out of this lane) with
  `LEAN_STATUS: NOT_STARTED`;
* `CoarseGraining`'s relative, `Ch03.generalCoarseGrainingL2TwoExponentTheory`, is the
  **`p = 2` / negative-Besov-`L²`** package
  (`homogenizationComparisonNegativeBesovLHS`), not the `W̲^{-s,∞}` object this
  step needs;
* it is recorded that the literal endpoint `p = ∞` is UNAVAILABLE from the
  source (the dual exponent `p' = 1` breaks the flat-cube CZ estimate behind
  the Calderón--Zygmund flux comparison lemma), and neither a `p`-uniformity remark on `C(p,d)` nor an
  explicit large-`q` conclusion is given.

The chain that consumes that Proposition reads the `p → ∞` reading of its
display through a transcribed `hCG` binder.  The `W̲^{-s,∞}` left-hand side is
carried as an abstract nonnegative real, so nothing about the negative-norm
carrier is assumed either.

## What is proved

The elementary arithmetic behind the gap absorption: `1 < log 3`
(`one_lt_log_three`) and the lever `t^5 ≤ 3125 e^t` (`pow_five_le_exp`).
Together they give the "`gapAbsorb` computation"
`s^{-9/2}3^{(n-m)/2} ≤ C_gap0(d-free) γ^5` at the EXPLICIT constant
`C_gap0 = (log 3 - 1)^{-5}`.  `5 log 3 = 5.49… > 5` is genuine and is exactly the
slack the proof spends; the lever is `t ≤ exp t` applied at
`t = (log 3 - 1)|log γ|`, with no series and no factorials.
