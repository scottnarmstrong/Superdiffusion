# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 1 RE-PINNED: the anchor at the base
# `s/8` and at the two enlarged-`Y` indices

## What this module is

The SIBLING of `HomStepOneAnchor.exists_ethmB_factor_moments`, at the two
re-pins the §4.5 lane now carries:

* the BASE re-pin `s ↦ s/8` of `HomSeamRepin.homSeamBase` (an INSTANTIATION of
  the `HomStepEnvelope.ethmB`, no new object): the two mesoscale `𝓔`
  factors move from `s/2`, `s/4` to `s/16`, `s/32`;
* the `Y`-slot ENLARGEMENT of `HomSpineTopScale.stepTwoEnlargedY`
  (discharged at `K_idx = 1` by
  `HomSpineTopScale.stepTwoIndexBridge_of_representative`): the printed
  minimal-scale slot `Y = 3^{(1-α)X_m(α)}` is multiplied by the two honest
  Step-2 indices `(1 + 𝓔_{t/2,∞,2}(□_m))(1 + 𝓔_{t,∞,2}(□_m))`.  Those are two
  MORE `𝓔` factors for the print's own Step-1 Hölder budget
  (the `bounds_mathcal_E_aL` lemma moments), and they are produced here.

So the eighth anchor is applied FIVE times rather than three:

| factor | anchor exponent `s'` | gap `m − n` | anchor bracket `s'⁻¹ + √(m−n)` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `𝓔_{s'/2}(□_m, n)`, `s' = s/8` | `s/16` | `k` | `≤ 18|log γ|` |
| `𝓔_{1/4}(□_m)`                 | `1/4`  | `0` | `= 4`         |
| `𝓔_{s'/4}(□_m, n)`, `s' = s/8` | `s/32` | `k` | `≤ 34|log γ|` |
| `𝓔_{t/2}(□_m)` (enlarged `Y`)  | `t/2`  | `0` | `= 2 t⁻¹`     |
| `𝓔_{t}(□_m)` (enlarged `Y`)    | `t`    | `0` | `= t⁻¹`       |

with `s = |log γ|⁻¹`, `k = ⌈10|log γ|⌉`, `n = m − k`.

## The three numerals, machine-measured

* **the quartic γ-gauge `16 → 128`**.  The anchor's lower `s`-endpoint
  `C_A² √γ ≤ s'` binds at the SMALLEST slot, which is now
  `homQuarterOf (homSeamBase M hs) = s/32` instead of the `s/4`.  Via
  `absLog_mul_sqrt_le` (`|log γ|√γ ≤ 4 γ^{1/4}`) the requirement is
  `32 · 4 · C_A² γ^{1/4} ≤ 1`, i.e. `γ^{1/4} ≤ (128 C_A²)⁻¹` — exactly eight
  times the `(16 C_A²)⁻¹`.  This is `homSeamGamma0` below.
* **the `q`-range lower gate `8d|log γ| → 64 d |log γ|`**.  The binding slot is
  again `s/32`: the anchor asks `2d (s/32)⁻¹ = 64 d |log γ| ≤ q`, and the
  hypothesis `hq_lo` sits AT that equality.  The scaling is therefore exactly
  `×8` off the `8 d |log γ|`, matching the gauge's `×8`.  The
  `32 d |log γ|` was understated by a factor two.
* **the upper endpoint `homConst C_A = 200 max(C_A, 1)` is UNCHANGED**.  The
  tightest divisor of the `q`-upper endpoint moves `4 → 32`, and the
  produced constant must dominate `3 · C_A · 34 = 102 C_A` (the `s/32` slot,
  with the IMPROVED `3`-power, see below); both fit under `200 max(C_A,1)`,
  headroom `200/32` on the endpoint and `200/102` on the majorant.

The `3`-power budget IMPROVES and is what keeps `200` sufficient: at the
re-pinned base the anchor exponents are `(1/2)(s/16)k ≤ 3/8` and `(1/2)(s/32)k
≤ 3/16`, so `3^{·} ≤ 3` (`rpow_three_le_three`) replaces the `3^{·} ≤ 27`.
With the `27` the `s/32` slot would need `27 · 34 C_A = 918 C_A` and `200`
would NOT suffice.

## The index bookkeeping of the enlarged `Y` (the honest binders)

The two new factors sit at gap `0` (`n = m`), so their `3`-power is `3^0 = 1`
and their bracket is exactly `(t/2)⁻¹ = 2 t⁻¹` resp. `t⁻¹`.  The anchor's own
admissible range then forces exactly two binders on `t`, both DISPLAYED:

* `t ≤ 1/4` — the anchor's `s`-range has the CLOSED right endpoint `1/4`.  This
  is a genuine NARROWING of the correction's `t < 1/2`; the consumer
  must choose its Step-2 Besov index at or below `1/4`.  Nothing else in the
  Step-2 chain resists: `t ≤ 1/4 < 1/2` is strictly stronger than what
 needs.
* `homS M / 8 ≤ t` — i.e. `t` at or above the re-pinned base.  This is what
  keeps BOTH new slots inside the single gate `64 d |log γ|`:
  `2d (t/2)⁻¹ = 4 d t⁻¹ ≤ 32 d |log γ|` and `2 d t⁻¹ ≤ 16 d |log γ|`.  It also
  supplies the anchor's lower `s`-endpoint for them, since
  `C_A² √γ ≤ s/32 ≤ s/16 ≤ t/2`.  It is a vanishing constraint (`s/8 ≤ 1/32`
  and `s → 0` with `γ`), so any fixed positive Step-2 index satisfies it for
  small `γ`.

CORRECTION to this file brief: the gate moves to `64 d |log γ|` because of the
`s/32` slot of the BASE re-pin, NOT because of the two new factors.  The new
factors are merely ACCOMMODATED by `64 d |log γ|`, and only under
`homS M / 8 ≤ t`.

`t⁻¹` is kept VISIBLE in the two new majorants rather than absorbed into
`|log γ|` (no silent absorption of a parameter-dependent
quantity).  At the consumer's natural choice `t = 1/4` it is the constant `4`,
so the Step-1 display's `|log γ|²` is NOT degraded; had it been absorbed by
`t⁻¹ ≤ 8|log γ|` the display would have had to carry `|log γ|³`.

/-- **THE RE-PINNED STEP-1 FACTOR MOMENTS.**

The sibling of `HomStepOneAnchor.exists_ethmB_factor_moments` at the re-pinned
base `homSeamBase M hs = s/8` AND at the two enlarged-`Y` indices `t/2`, `t` of
`HomSpineTopScale.stepTwoEnlargedY`.  The `bounds_mathcal_E_aL` lemma
is applied five times; every hypothesis below is either one of the anchor's own
binders, discharged here, or one of the four displayed gates
(`homS M / 8 ≤ t`, `t ≤ 1/4`, `64 d |log γ| ≤ q`, `q ≤ C⁻¹ γ⁻¹ s`).

The `t⁻¹` of the last two majorants is deliberately NOT absorbed into
`|log γ|`; see the module docstring. -/
