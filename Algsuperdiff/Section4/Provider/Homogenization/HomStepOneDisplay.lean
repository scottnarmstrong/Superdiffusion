# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 1: the printed display the `𝓔` estimate

## The target

The Step-1 conclusion, in the ADOPTED form of (fix 2):

```
𝔼[ EthmB(m)^p ]^{1/p}  ≤  C ( √p + √|log γ| ) √γ (log γ)²
```

for `p ∈ [1, C⁻¹ γ⁻¹ |log γ|⁻¹]`, in the `lintegral` normal form `∫⁻ EthmB^p ≤
(ofReal R)^p`.

The `√|log γ|` summand is NOT cosmetic: it is exactly the anchor's own
lower moment endpoint `q ≥ 2 d s'⁻¹`, which at the §4.5 exponents reads
`q ≥ 8 d |log γ|`.  The assembly below evaluates the anchor at
`q = max(4p, 8d|log γ|)` and `√q ≤ 2√p + √(8d)√|log γ|` is where the second
summand comes from.  The printed `√p` alone is unreachable below
`p ≈ d|log γ|`; this module states the reachable bound.

## The `Cgap`-explicit constant

The produced constant is `C₀ (1 + C_gap)`, LINEAR in the Step-3 gap constant
`C_gap` of `EthmB`'s second summand, with `C₀ = C₀(d, c⋆)` independent of it.
Keeping `C_gap` a free parameter rather than fixing it here is the honest
reading: the source's `C` in `C γ⁵` is pinned by Step 3, not by Step 1, and
(the Step-3 rescaling of the witness) then costs exactly one more factor,
absorbed by `lintegral_rpow_const_mul_le`.

## The conditional set (exactly one edge)

`hY` — the Markov/`Γ₁` moment `𝔼[(3^{(1-α)X_m(α)})^{2p}] ≤ 2^{2p}` of the
Theorem-C minimal-scale factor, transcribed as a named hypothesis at the single
exponent it is consumed at.  Theorem C is a declared dependency of the Step 1
(the moment bound).  NOTHING else is assumed.

/-! ## 2. The purely algebraic collapse -/

/-- **The Step-1 numeric collapse**, over abstract reals.

`W` is `√q`, `S` is `√p + √|log γ|`, `G` is `√γ`, `L` is `|log γ|`, `A` the
anchor's factor constant and `D = 2 + √(8d)` the `√max` loss.  Nothing
`γ`-dependent is hidden: every hypothesis is displayed. -/
