# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 4: the pairing carrier

## The object

Step 4 uses the negative norm `‖·‖_{Ŵ̲^{-s,∞}(□_m)}` in exactly one way, the
two duality pairings of the manuscript:

```text
  |⨍_{□_m} ∇v · F|  ≤  ‖∇v‖_{W̲^{s,∞}(□_m)} ‖F‖_{Ŵ̲^{-s,∞}(□_m)}.
```

The manuscript **never defines** `Ŵ^{-s,p}` (the manuscript defines only the
order `-1` duals, and it defines *those* by duality: a supremum of `∫_U f g`
over a normalized test class).  Following that pattern — and the corrected
rendering of the same symbol — the carrier here is the
**duality form**: `WeakNegDualBoundOn Q s W F` *is* the family of pairing
inequalities.  The Step-4 pairing is then a theorem
(`WeakNegDualBoundOn.pairing`) rather than an assumption.

## The test gauge

`wsInftyGauge Q s Ksup KHol = 3^{-s·Q.scale} · Ksup + KHol` is the printed display's
volume-normalized Hölder norm `‖φ‖_{C̲^{0,s}(□_m)} = |□_m|^{-s/d}‖φ‖_{L^∞} +
[φ]_{C^{0,s}}`, which the manuscript declares interchangeable with
`‖·‖_{W̲^{s,∞}(□_m)}` up to dimensional constants.  Both halves are carried:
The manuscript's Step-4 test function is `∇v`, whose mean does **not** vanish,
so the `L^∞` half is load-bearing (see the disclosure below).

## Two inequivalent renderings of one printed symbol

The §4.5 negative-norm symbol is consumed at two sites that demand
**inequivalent** objects:

* Step 3c (the `L^∞` upgrade) needs the *multiscale* reading — a bound on the
  cube averages of `F` at every scale (this file's `negBesovInftyNorm`,
  this file's `UniformBoxGaugeBound`).  A single-scale duality bound does not
  give it: it loses `r^{-d}` (machine-checked).
* Step 4 (here) needs the *duality* reading.  The multiscale reading does not
  give it either: pairing `B^{s}_{∞,∞}` against `B^{-s}_{∞,∞}` diverges
  logarithmically in the number of scales (the increments contribute a
  constant per scale).

Neither implies the other.  Both are legitimate readings of an undefined
printed symbol; each Step consumes the one it needs, and each is disclosed at
its own consumption site.

## The hat

The printed display's `Ŵ^{-1,p'}` restricts the test class to **mean-zero**
`g`.  Under the hatted reading the pairing above is valid only for mean-zero
`φ`; the general `φ` splits as `φ = (φ)_{□_m} + (φ - (φ)_{□_m})` and the
constant part pairs against `⨍_{□_m} F`.  `weakNegDual_of_hat_of_mean_zero`
records the case in which the two coincide — `⨍_{□_m} F = 0`, which is exactly
the gradient leg `F = ∇u - ∇v` with `u - v ∈ H¹₀(□_m)`.  For the **flux** leg
`F = a_L∇u - σ̄_m∇v` the mean does not vanish and is not controlled by the
hatted norm; that is the second half of the correction draft.

The predicate *is* the family of pairing inequalities the manuscript uses:
for every test field `φ` with volume-normalized Hölder norm at most
`wsInftyGauge Q s Ksup KHol`,

```text
  |⨍_{□} F · φ| ≤ W · (3^{-s·m} Ksup + KHol).
```

This is the printed display's own definitional pattern for the negative-order
duals, transported from order `-1` to order `-s`.  `CoarseGraining`'s
`cubeEuclideanNegativeWspSmoothDualENorm`
(`Homogenization/Sobolev/Fractional/EuclideanWspSmoothDual.lean`) is the same
construction at a bundled `L²` carrier and smooth tests; the lightweight
predicate here is the one the §4.5 consumers need. -/
