# The re-cut core, produced: all twelve conjuncts at the corrected pin

## What this file supplies

`HomSpineInstallPins` installs the twelve-conjunct core of the §4.5 bundle.
All twelve conjuncts are available at the corrected numeral pin `p = 4d`,
`s = |log γ|⁻¹`, `s₂ = 49/100`, `j_n = ⌈10|log γ|⌉`, from one per-`ω` supplier
and a frame condition on `K_abs`:

| conjunct | where it comes from |
|:-- |:-- |
| `0 < j_n`, the guard, the window, `0 ≤ C_w` | the numeral pin (proved here) |
| `spineClauseConst … ≤ K_abs` | `hKabs`, a frame condition on the free `K_abs` |
| `0 ≤ E_B`, `ofReal E_B ≤ EthmB(m)` | the real cut of `EthmB(m)` (proved here) |
| the MULTISCALE clause | the supplier (the coarse-graining input) |
| `0 ≤ S`, the partial sums | the supplier |
| `hlevel`, `hlevelDual` | `HomSpineResidueLevel` (the `EthmB(m)` pairing) |

So the residual bill of Theorem B's §4.5 spine is exactly that supplier plus
`hfin` and `hKabs`.

## The residual bill, itemized

The supplier asks, for each `L ≥ m` and each printed elliptic pair, for

1. the energy partial-sum slot `S` with the printed bound `hSbound` at the
   Step-2 constant shape `C · 3^{(1-α)X_m}(1 + 𝓔_{1/4})` — **this is the
   Theorem-C item**;
2. the MULTISCALE coarse-graining clause at `Gen:= printedLocalEnergy`;
3. the two `𝓔`-dominations — **the carrier seam**, disclosed in
   `HomSpineResiduePairing` and NOT dischargeable at the current pins.

`hfin` is the a.e. finiteness of the `[0,∞]` carrier, which
`HomSpineFinalWitness` already derives from the `p = 1` moment.
