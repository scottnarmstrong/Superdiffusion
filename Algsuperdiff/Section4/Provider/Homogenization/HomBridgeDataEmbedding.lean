# Theorem B, §4.5, Step 2: the data embedding `C^{0,1/2} ↪ H̲^s(□_m)`

## The target

Step 2 of Theorem B prices the Step-2 solution by its data.  The datum enters
Theorem C through the Besov leg `3^{sm} [g]_{H̲^s(□_m)}`, while the §4.5
normalization supplies only the HÖLDER bound

```
  [g]_{C^{0,1/2}(□_m)} ≤ 1        and       ‖∇h‖_{C^{0,1/2}(□_m)} ≤ 1.
```

The missing conversion — the obstruction (4) — is

```
  [g]_{C^{0,1/2}(□_m)} ≤ K   ⟹   3^{sm} [g]_{H̲^s(□_m)} ≤ C(d,s) K 3^{m/2}
```

for `0 < s < 1/2`, together with the identical statement for `∇h`.  This module
gives it.

## Most of the engine is already available

The conversion is not new analysis.  Both the Gagliardo engine and its `□_m`
instance are already in this repository:

* `Provider.Regularity.normalizedGagliardoESeminormOn_le_of_holderHalf`
  (`HolderGagliardoEmbedding.lean`) — the window-free atom
  `[g]_{H̲^s(A)} ≤ K (C_rad(d,β) · R^d · R^{-β})^{1/2}`, `β = d + 2s - 1`, for
  any window `A` of sup-diameter `≤ R`, at the very carriers this repository uses;
* `Provider.Regularity.radialKernelConst_holderGagliardoBeta_le` /
  `stepFourGagliardoConst_le` (`HolderGagliardoRangeGuard.lean`) — the constant
  `C_rad(d, d+2s-1) ≤ 2^{d+1} 3^d (1-2s)^{-1}`, i.e. the correction's
  `(1-2s)^{-1/2}`;
* `Provider.Regularity.three_rpow_mul_normalizedGagliardoESeminormOn_cube_le`
  (`StepFourSeminormComparisons.lean`) — **the target display itself**, at the
  window `openCubeSet (originCube d m)`:
  `3^{ms}[g]_{H̲^s(□_m)} ≤ K · C_{S4.4}(d,s) · 3^{m/2}`, generic in `E`, so the
  `g` leg and the `∇h` leg are ONE declaration.

Nothing here re-derives any of that.  The honest residue, and the whole content
of this module, is:

1. `homDataConst` + `stepFourGagliardoConst_le_homDataConst` — the range
   guard bounds the constant only in its `s`-dependent form
   `(2^{d+1} 3^d / (1-2s))^{1/2}`, which blows up as `s → 1/2`.  §4.5 runs at
   `s = |log γ|⁻¹`, which is `≤ 1/4` but never a fixed numeral, so what is
   needed is one `γ`-free constant valid on the whole RANGE `0 < s ≤ 1/4`; it
   is supplied here.
2. `cubeSet_subset_ball_of_mem` — the window geometry a general-cube reading
   needs.  Step 2b's windows are `z + □_j` for `z ∈ 3^j ℤ^d ∩ □_m`, i.e.
   arbitrary triadic cubes, while the Support layer's correspondence anchor
   is stated at the HALF-OPEN
   realization; it is that realization which makes the ball radius exactly the
   side length `3^m` (each coordinate inequality is strict), with no
   dimensional loss.

## The constant

`stepFourGagliardoConst d s = C_rad(d, d+2s-1)^{1/2}` carries `(1-2s)^{-1/2}`
and therefore is NOT a constant as `s → 1/2`.  The §4.5 instance is protected by
's gate `s = |log γ|⁻¹ ≤ 1/4` (carried by `HomStepEnvelope`'s
`homS_le_quarter`), at which `1 - 2s ≥ 1/2` and the constant collapses to the
genuinely `γ`-free `homDataConst d = (2^{d+2} 3^d)^{1/2}`.  It is that pinned
`C(d)` form which is stated here.
