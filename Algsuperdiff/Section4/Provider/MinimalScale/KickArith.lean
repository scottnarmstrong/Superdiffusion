# Arithmetic for the Step-1 annular kick family

ABK26, §4.2, Step 1 of `l.minimal.scale.sep`.  Two of the manuscript's Step-1
moves are pure real arithmetic that the printed text performs silently, and both
are load-bearing for the amplitudes:

* **the geometric closures.**  The union-bound penalties of the lattice annulus
  are `(j−i+1)^{1/σ}`, i.e. `√(j−i+1)` on the `Γ₂` lane and `(j−i+1)²` on the
  `Γ_{1/2}` lane.  Summed against the §4.2 weight `3^{−½s(j−i)}` these give
  `s^{−3/2}` and `s^{−3}`.  The `√` closure is the sharp one — the crude `√(r+1)
  ≤ r+1` gives `s^{−2}` and does **not** reproduce the printed `s^{−5/2}` — and
  is the proved `Probability.tsum_threePow_neg_sqrt_le`; its `(r+1)²` companion
  is proved here, and `geomTailConst_le` converts both closure constants into
  explicit powers of `s`.

* **the absorptions.**  The `s`-powers picked up on the `Γ_{1/2}` lane must
  disappear into the exponential, because prints the amplitude `C
  exp(−C^{−1}c⋆³γ^{−1})` with **no** power of `s` in front.  The manuscript
  says only "for `C` chosen sufficiently large".  `inv_cube_mul_exp_le`
  performs the `s^{−3}` absorption on the window `s ≥ 8γ`, and
  `exp_neg_eighth_le_sqrt` performs the absorption the Step-1 collapse needs,
  namely that the fourth root of the exponentially small amplitude is below the
  `Γ₂` amplitude `C c⋆^{−1}s^{−5/2}√γ`.  Both consume the regime `γ ≤
  C^{−10}c⋆^{10}` through the single lemma `pow_le_expArg_mul`, which reads the
  regime as a *lower* bound on the exponent `C^{−1}c⋆³γ^{−1}`.  Without such a
  lower bound the absorbed prefactor would carry `c⋆^{−9}`, which is not a
  dimensional constant: this is exactly where the regime is used.

## The regime, honestly

The absorptions are proved from `γ ≤ C^{−10}c⋆^{10}`, which is **the enclosing
lemma's own printed hypothesis** and is also what the proved producer of the
per-cube two-term display carries.

## Why there is no `nlinarith`

Every statement here involves `Real.exp`, `Real.log`, `Real.sqrt` or `Real.rpow`.
All transcendental content is concentrated in `pow_mul_exp_neg_half_le`
(`xⁿe^{−x/2} ≤ (2n)ⁿ`, itself only `x ≤ eˣ` raised to the `n`-th power); after
that every step is polynomial and closed by `linarith only`, `field_simp` or
`ring`.  The collapse absorption squares both sides, which removes every root
before any arithmetic happens.

/-- **The `s^{−3}` absorption.**  On the window `s ≥ 8γ` and in the regime `γ ≤

`s^{−3} exp(−C^{−1}c⋆³γ^{−1}) ≤ (216C³ + 10⁵C^{−15}) exp(−½C^{−1}c⋆³γ^{−1})`,

so the `s^{−3}` of the `(j−i+1)²` union-bound penalty leaves no trace in the

doubling the dimensional constant). -/
