# The transposed ugly estimate, discharged by the `(J3)` symmetry

ABK26, Section 4.1, `p.mathcalE.annular.decomp`: the manuscript runs
`e.ugly.estimate.for.J` a second time for the transposed field and asserts the
same right-hand side.

This module formalizes exactly that argument.  Write `N ω = −ω` for the proved
negation of the whole shell sequence on the genuine lower-tail carrier
(`Cutoff.negateCutoffSample`).  Then:

1. `a_L(Nω) = a_L(ω)ᵀ` — the proved `(J3)` carrier identity
   `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff_negateCutoffSample_eq_adjoint`, itself a
   consequence of the proved skewness of the genuine lower-infinite cutoff;
2. the flux-correction constant `(k_L − k_m)_{□_m}` is linear in the shell
   fields, so it changes sign under `N` (`fluxIncrementAverage_negateCutoffSample`),
   and therefore `ã_{L,m}(Nω) = ã_{L,m}(ω)ᵀ` pointwise
   (`fluxCorrectedField_negateCutoffSample`);
3. every shell-norm-built slot is literally `N`-invariant, and the two
   variational slots (`λ_{γ,2}` and `𝓔_{s,2,2}`) are `N`-invariant because the
   skew part drops out of the coarse quadratic form
   (`NegationSymmetry.lean`, `TransposeError.lean`);
4. consequently the transposed `J`-leg at `ω` **is** the field `J`-leg at `Nω`
   (`jLegField_negateCutoffSample`), and the ugly estimate for the transposed
   field at `ω` **is** the proved field-side ugly estimate
   (`exists_uglyJEstimate_annulus_of_eventG1`) evaluated at `Nω`.

The ugly estimate itself is never re-proved: it is *transported*.  And the
transport is **deterministic** — the ruled "same law" is not consumed.  Every
step above is a pointwise identity on the carrier, so the transposed estimate
holds at each individual sample, not merely in law; the proved
`Cutoff.map_negateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw` is not used.  The only
almost-sure input is the atom-versus-representative reconciliation
`annularErrorAtomMax_ae_le_annularErrorLatticeMax`, which the field-side leg
already consumes at the same place.

## The payoff

The transposed ugly estimate is thereby available at **every** sample, with the
transposed response family no longer a free variable: it is the concrete
`fun ω L ↦ annularResponseMax M L m (N ω)`.  A consumer of it is therefore a
transcription of the field-side leg, not a substitution.  Because the
atom-versus-representative reconciliation is only almost sure, the transposed
estimate has to be produced **inside** the `filter_upwards` of the display,
exactly where the field-side estimate already is.
