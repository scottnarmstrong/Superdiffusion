# The `(2,2)` error transport

ABK26, Section 4.1 reads the homogenization-error functional `𝓔_{s,p,q}` on
the **translated** cube `z + □_n`, and then feeds it to the Section 2.4
sensitivity machinery, which is stated only on the **unit** cube.  The bridge
between the two is the manuscript's unremarked change of variables `y ↦ z +
3^n y`.

`Section3.Provider.BadEvents.unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` performs exactly that
change of variables on the coefficient cutoff: the sample is translated by the
base point `z = triadicCubeShift Q` of the cube, and the resulting triadic
family is dilated by `3^{-Q.scale}` onto the unit cube.  It is the object at
which the frozen Section 2.4 lower-ellipticity gate is already read
(`unitCubeLambda_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff`).  This module supplies the same
identification for the **error** functional.

## What is proved

* `unitCubeHomogenizationError_dilatedFamily` — the reusable core: for *any*
  triadic coefficient family `F`, *any* exponent pair and *any* comparator
  matrix, the frozen unit-cube error of the root of `dilate (-m) F` is the
  literal manuscript error on `□_m` of `F` itself.  This is the statement a
  flux-corrected rescaling layer will consume verbatim once a flux-corrected
  triadic family exists; nothing in it mentions the cutoff.
* `unitCubeHomogenizationError_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` — its instance at the
  proved rescaling layer, i.e. the transport at the plain cutoff family
  `Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily`.
* `unitCubeHomogenizationError_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff_eq_cutoffRaw` and
  `..._eq_cutoffRaw22` — the two literal-observable legs, at `(∞,2)` and at
  `(2,2)`.
* `unitCubeHomogenizationError22_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff_eq_annularErrorAtom` —
  the `𝒢₂` normalization (cutoff level `n − 2`, comparator `σ̄_{n−2} Id`) at a
  lattice cube `⟨n, v⟩`: the unit-cube error at the rescaled coefficient object
  is literally `Support.annularErrorAtom M n t` evaluated at the sample
  translated by `Support.triadicLatticePoint n v`.  This is the
  translated-sample rendering used throughout.

## Exact, not almost-everywhere

Every identity above is an **exact pointwise equality of reals**: no null set,
no representative choice, no normalization constant.  The reason is structural.
The frozen characterization
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section24.unitCubeHomogenizationError_characterization` is
quantified over *every* compatible family; at the root of a dilated family the
compatible family is that dilated family itself, so its a.e. side condition is
discharged by `CoeffOn.A.refl`.  CoarseGraining's
`Book.Ch02.HomogenizationErrorOnCube_dilate` is an equality with factor `1`,
and the `(2,2)` characterization of `Support.cutoffHomogenizationErrorRaw22`
proves on the very same `HomogenizationErrorOnCube` expression, so the two ends
meet with no residual scaling.

The single a.e. statement in this file is
`unitCubeHomogenizationError22_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff_ae_eq_annularErrorObservable`,
and its null set comes from elsewhere: it is the composition of the exact
identity with `Support.annularErrorAtom_ae_eq_annularErrorObservable`, where a
*measurable modification* is selected, as everywhere in the `𝒢₂` lane.
Transporting that a.e. identity along the translation is legitimate because
every real translation preserves the cutoff-sample law
(`GoodEvents.measurePreserving_translateCutoffSample`).

## Route

```
unitCubeHomogenizationError t p q (unitRescaledCutoffCoeff M Q L ω) a₀
   = 𝓔(□₀; dilate (−Q.scale) (a_L at ω translated by z), a₀)     [frozen char.]
   = 𝓔(□_{Q.scale}; a_L at ω translated by z, a₀)  [CoarseGraining ..._dilate]
   = annularErrorAtom M Q.scale t (translate z ω)  [(2,2) char., backwards]
```

## What the manuscript says, and does not say

`d.mathcal.E` extends the error functional to translated cubes in exactly one
sentence -- *"We extend these definitions to translations `y + □_m` of `□_m` in
the obvious way"* -- and says nothing at all about the behaviour of `𝓔` under a
dilation.  The only explicit rescale-and-translate passage in the manuscript (
inside the proof of `l.lambda.sensitivity`) is written for `λ_{s,q}`, not for
`𝓔`.

The rescaling this module supplies is therefore the step ABK26 performs
*silently*.  What is proved here is the *error* half of that step, and it is
proved as an exact equality, so no constant and no inequality direction is
introduced.

* -- the "obvious way" extension is a theorem, and is a.e.-tolerant.  The
  rendering used here is the proved Support convention (translate the *sample*,
  never the cube), so no off-grid cube object is
  introduced and the a.e. tolerance is not consumed.
* -- the `q = ∞` branches should sum to `l ≤ n`, not `l ≤ m`.  Invisible here:
  every statement in this module is at `n = m` (`HomogenizationErrorOnCube`
  fixes `n := Q.scale`).
* Every comparator below is `isotropicComparatorMatrix σ` with `σ` a
  `PositiveScalar`, which is that locus (and is `scalarMatrix (σ : ℝ)` on the
  nose).
* -- all concern constants, exponents, annulus multiplicity or the truncation
  level *inside* the estimates, not the definition of the functional or its
  behaviour under the change of variables.  None bears on an equality of two
  readings of the same functional.

`Homogenization.triadicCubeShift`, and it is what lets the transport below be
read at the lattice enumerations of `Support.latticeAnnulusSet`. -/

/-! ## The reusable dilation glue -/

/-- **The scale normalization of the homogenization error.**  For an arbitrary
triadic coefficient family `F`, the frozen unit-cube error functional read at
the root restriction of the `3^{-m}`-dilated family is exactly the literal
manuscript error `𝓔_{s,p,q}(□_m; F, a₀)`.

Nothing here is specific to the coefficient cutoff, to the exponents, or to an
isotropic comparator; this is the statement any *other* rescaling layer (for
instance a flux-corrected one) consumes unchanged, once it exhibits its
coefficient object as the root of a dilated triadic family. -/

at the rescaled coefficient object `unitRescaledCutoffCoeff M Q L ω`, is the
literal manuscript error functional on the *centered* cube of the same scale as
`Q`, evaluated at the sample translated by the base point of `Q`.

This holds at every exponent pair, every comparator matrix, every cube and
every cutoff level; the `𝒢₂` atom below is one instance. -/

/-- **The `(2,2)` error transport at the `𝒢₂` normalization, cube form.**  The
frozen unit-cube error, read at the coefficient cutoff of level `Q.scale − 2`
rescaled from `Q` onto the unit cube and compared against `σ̄_{Q.scale−2} Id`,
is exactly the `𝒢₂` atom of `Support.ErrorAtoms` at the sample translated by
the base point of `Q`.

Both sides are the *literal* manuscript quantity, and the equality is exact. -/
