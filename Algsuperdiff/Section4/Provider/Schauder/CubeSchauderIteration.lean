# Cube Schauder: the de-randomized Campanato iteration

The recursion produced by the freezing step of `CubeSchauderFreezing` at the
triadic sub-scales of a cube has the shape

```text
  E (k+1) ≤ theta * E k + F * rho ^ k ,
```

where `E k` is the excess at scale `3^{-k}`, `theta` is the contraction factor
supplied by the interior (or reflected boundary) regularity of the frozen
harmonic comparison function, `rho = 3^{-alpha}` is the freezing gain, and `F`
is the `C^{0,alpha}` seminorm of the forcing.  Whenever `theta < rho < 1` the
iteration closes at the *forcing* rate:

```text
  E k ≤ (E 0 + F / (rho - theta)) * rho ^ k ,
```

which is exactly the Campanato bound whose Morrey dual is `∇u ∈ C^{0,alpha}`.

At the development's exponent `alpha = 1/2` the rate is `rho = 3^{-1/2}`, i.e.
the `3^{-k/2}` decay of the target `ZeroDatumCubeSchauder`.

Nothing in this module is an elliptic estimate: every declaration is an
unconditional statement about real sequences, plus the triadic dictionary that
identifies `rho ^ k` with the gauge `3^{-k/2}` of the frozen conclusion.

## Main results

* `excess_le_of_recursion` — the sharp induction: the recursion propagates the
  ansatz `theta ^ k * + (F / (rho - theta)) * rho ^ k`.
* `excess_le_geometric` — the Campanato form `E k ≤ ( + F/(rho-theta)) rho^k`.
* `excess_le_geometric_triadic_half` — the same at `rho = 3^{-1/2}`, spelled in
  the frozen gauge `Real.rpow 3 (-(k/2))`.
* `excess_le_of_recursion_of_le` — the degenerate-rate variant `theta ≤ rho`
  with a strict inequality only at the reabsorption step.

/-- **The Campanato induction.**

If a nonnegative sequence contracts at rate `theta` with a forcing remainder
decaying at the strictly larger rate `rho`, then it is dominated by the sum of
the two geometric profiles, with the forcing amplified by the *gap* `rho - theta`
only.  This is the reabsorption at the heart of `e.Sch1a.1`. -/
