# `t.regularity` Step 4: the `ε_j` leg of the collapse

## The target

```text
   𝓔_{s/8,∞,2}(z + □_{n+1}; 𝐚_L − (κ_L − κ_{n+1})_{…}, σ̄_{n+1})
      =  Support.fluxCorrectedErrorRepresentative M L (n+1) ⟨s/8⟩ (τ_z ω) ,
```

while the Step-5 slot `ε_j` (`StepFiveBudgetSums.stepFiveEps`) is the `sup_{L ≥
j}` observable, restricted to the good event and pushed through `ENNReal.toReal`.

## Two exact alignments, and one shift

* **The gate is literally the same set.**  The excess-decay supply event is
  `goodEventAt M (cgEllipLowerConstant d) (n-2+3) z ⟨s/8⟩ (s/8 · √δ)` and
  `ε_j`'s indicator is
  `goodEventAt M (cgEllipLowerConstant d) j z ⟨s_8⟩ (stepOneEp δ)` with
  `stepOneEp δ = s_8 · √δ` and `s_8 = 1/32`.  At the Step-1 pin `s = 1/4` the
  two are the SAME term, constant for constant.
* **The observable is the same carrier**, and the per-level representative is
  dominated by the `sup_{L ≥ j}` observable
  (`Support.le_fluxCorrectedErrorObservableSup`) for every `L ≥ j`.
* **The scale shifts by one.**  The excess-decay display contracts the excess
  between scales `n` and `n-k`, but reads its error observable at `n-2+3 =
  n+1`.  Identifying the Step-5 index `j:= n` (which is what the excess indices
  force) therefore pins the Step-5 `ε`-slot at the shifted family `ε_{j+1}`.
  The shift is carried explicitly, not absorbed: `e.sum.eps.j.bound` is
  re-derived for it, at the same constant, from `GoodScaleWindows` on the
  shifted window `[n+1, m+1]`.

## The `toReal` corner, closed

`stepFiveEps` is a `toReal`, so a `⊤` observable would silently collapse the
slot to `0` and make the conversion.

/-- **The `ε_j` leg producer.**  On the good event, and with the observable
finite (the real cap `hcap`), the excess-decay lane's per-level flux-corrected
error at any truncation level `L ≥ j` is at most the Step-5 slot `ε_j`.

This is the exact conversion the Step-4 collapse needs: it turns the  leg datum
into the  `ε_j` at constant `1`. -/
