# `t.regularity` Step 5: the geometric tail of the `δ_j` series

## The target

ABK26 `t.regularity` Step 5: "Summing the series for the `δ_j` terms".  Both
non-`ε` legs of `δ_j` are geometrically dominated from the TOP scale `m`
downwards,

```text
   3^{j/2} σ̄_j^{-1}  ≤  C 3^{-(1/2 - γ)(m-j)} · 3^{m/2} σ̄_m^{-1} ,
   3^{j/2}            =      3^{-(1/2)(m-j)} · 3^{m/2} ,
```

so each contributes a convergent geometric series `∑_{j=n}^{m-1} r^{m-j}` with
`r ∈ (0,1)`, bounded by `r/(1-r)` uniformly in `n` and `m`.  This module is the
pure-real algebra of that summation, over an abstract ratio `r` and an abstract
dominated family, with no `rpow` and no `exp` anywhere: the caller supplies `r
:= 3^{-(1/2-γ)}` (resp.  `3^{-1/2}`) as an already-formed real in `(0,1)`, and
the integer exponent `m - j` is a `zpow`.

The partial sum is computed sharply (`sum_Icc_le_of_zpow_dominated_sharp`), because
the crude bound `r/(1-r)` is not preserved by the downward induction — adding a
term at the bottom of the window needs the exact residual `(r -
r^{m-n+1})/(1-r)`.

Proved by downward induction on `n` from `m`, which is why the sharp form is
needed: the crude bound is not an inductive invariant. -/

The uniformity in `n` is the whole point: `e.sum.delta.j.bound` has no `(m-n)`
factor on its two geometric legs. -/
