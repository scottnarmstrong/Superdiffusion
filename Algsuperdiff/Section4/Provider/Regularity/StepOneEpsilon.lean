# `t.regularity` Step 1: the annular-admissibility bullet and `ε_j(z)`

## The target

ABK26 `t.regularity` Step 1, (the first bullet's second half) (the definition
of `ε_j(z)` and its cap):

```
ε_j(z) := 𝓔_{s/8,∞,2}(z + □_j; a_L - (κ_L-κ_j)_{z+□_j}, σ̂_j) · 1_{𝒢(j,z; ⅛s, ⅛ s δ^{1/2})} ,
ε_j(z) ≤ C_{ann} s δ^{1/2} ≤ ½ s^{3/2} C_{edos}^{-1} 3^{-k/4} .
```

## The re-verification (binding)

The printed first bullet asks for `γ|log γ|² ≤ s c⋆² (⅛ s δ^{1/2})`; the frozen
producer is at the strengthened hypothesis `γ|log γ|² ≤ t^{3/2} c⋆² ε` with `t` the index
at which it is applied.  Step 1 applies it at `t = s/8` (that is the index
inside `𝒢(j,z; ⅛s, …)` and inside `ε_j(z)`) and at `ε = ⅛ s δ^{1/2}`, so the
honest requirement is

```
γ |log γ|²  ≤  (s/8)^{3/2} · c⋆² · (⅛ s δ^{1/2}) .
```

That requirement is carried here as a hypothesis of the cap, not discharged: it
is NOT a consequence of `γ ≤ γ₀` alone, because `δ` degenerates as `α → 1`, and
the lower bound on `δ` is the caller's own `α`-range hypothesis `α ≤ 1 - C(d,c⋆)
γ^{1/2}` (the S Step-1 bullet).

## Contents

* `stepOneEpsJ` — the definition of `ε_j(z)`, in the carriers the frozen
  producers use (`fluxCorrectedErrorObservableSup` at the `z`-translated sample,
  gated by `goodEventAt`, `ℝ≥0∞`-valued).
* `stepOneSEighth_mem_Icc` — the annular `s`-window at `γ ≤ 1/256`.
* `ae_stepOneEpsJ_le` — **the `ε_j(z)` cap**: `ε_j(z) ≤ C_ann · (⅛ s δ^{1/2})`
  almost surely, for every scale `j` and every centre `z`.

## Deviations from the printed text

1. **The `∞` slot.**  `ε_j(z)` is formed here with
   `Support.fluxCorrectedErrorObservableSup`, the supremum over the truncation
   levels `L ≥ j` of the flux-corrected `(∞,2)` representative — the object the
   frozen `p.minimal.scale.separation.sec4` and `p.mathcalE.annular.decomp`
   clauses both carry.  It dominates the printed per-`L` representative
   (`Support.le_fluxCorrectedErrorObservableSup`), so the cap proved here is
   stronger than the printed one at every fixed `L`.
2. **The centre.**  The frozen annular clause (ii) is stated at the centre `0`
   and the untranslated sample; the transport to `(z, z`-translated sample`)`
   is the proved law-preserving translation, not a new assumption.
3. **The cap's `ε` slot.**  The printed chain writes `ε_j(z) ≤ C_ann s δ^{1/2}`;
   the producer delivers `C_ann ε` at `ε = ⅛ s δ^{1/2}`, which is smaller.
