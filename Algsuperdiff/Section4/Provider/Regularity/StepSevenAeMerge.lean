# The countable-`L` almost-everywhere merge

## The gap this module closes

flagged, for the future `hstep4` supplier, that the proved §4.3 producers put
the infrared-cutoff quantifier OUTSIDE the almost-everywhere quantifier.  For
instance the excess-decay lane's harmonic-approximation provider concludes

```text
  ∀ L m n : ℤ, m ≤ L → … → ∀ᵐ ω ∂(law M), P L m n ω ,
```

whereas the §4.4 consumer needs the SINGLE null set

```text
  ∀ᵐ ω ∂(law M), ∀ L : ℤ, m ≤ L → P L m n ω .
```

The exchange is legitimate because `ℤ` is countable, and it is exactly
Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.ae_all_iff` / `MeasureTheory.ae_ball_iff`.  The merge
is proved here as a standalone
measure-theoretic lemma: this module imports only Mathlib, in particular no
§4.3 file, so no §4.3 statement is touched or re-elaborated.

## What is provided

* `ae_forall_of_forall_ae_of_countable` — the plain countable-index exchange
  with a guard predicate: from `∀ i, Q i → ∀ᵐ a, P i a` conclude
  `∀ᵐ a, ∀ i, Q i → P i a`.  The guard `Q` is arbitrary; the guarded index need
  not range over a subtype.

No measurability hypothesis appears anywhere: the a.e. filter is a
`CountableInterFilter`, and the merge uses nothing else.

## References

* Mathlib, `MeasureTheory.ae_all_iff`, `MeasureTheory.ae_ball_iff`.
* The excess-decay seal-distance lane (the consumer whose quantifier order
  motivates this file; NOT imported).

The guarded indices form a countable subfamily of a countable family, so the
exceptional set is a countable union of null sets.  No measurability of `P` is
needed. -/
