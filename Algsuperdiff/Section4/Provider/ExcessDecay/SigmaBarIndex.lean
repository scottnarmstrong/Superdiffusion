# The `σ̄` index conversion at a two-scale gap, binder-free

This module closes that conversion **inside the anchor's own regime**: the
induction-state binder that `Annular.SigmaBarBudget.sigmaBar_ratio_le_four`
carries is discharged internally by
`GoodEvents.exists_allScalesInductionState`, at the landmark `m₀ := n+2` (resp.
`m₀ := n`), so nothing beyond `γ ≤ C^{-1} c⋆^{10}` is asked of the caller.
This is the `B1` wrapper pattern of `Provider/BoundsEaL/StepFourSigmaBar.lean`,
re-derived here so that the `BoundsEaL` tree is not imported.

```text
   σ̄_{n+2}^{-1} ≤ 4 σ̄_n^{-1}        (the direction the anchor's display needs)
   σ̄_n^{-1}     ≤ 7 σ̄_{n+2}^{-1}    (the converse, at the same regime)
```

Both constants are absolute numerals: no `s`, no `γ`, no `c⋆`, no dimension.
The regime is written in the frozen theorem's own shape `γ ≤ C^{-1} c⋆^{10}`
(the induction-state producer's shape `γ ≤ (C₀^{-1})^{10} c⋆^{10}` is reached
by exporting `C := C₀^{10}`).

## Where the constants come from

`σ̄` is *almost monotone* in the scale, in both directions, because the
induction state pins `σ̄_m^2` inside a factor-`4` window around `max(c⋆ γ^{-1}
3^{2γm}, ν^2)`, and that window's own ratio across two scales is `3^{4γ} ≤ 3`
at the standing `γ ≤ 1/4`.  Upward: the window is monotone in `m`, so the two
factor-`4` branches give `σ̄_n ≤ 4 σ̄_{n+2}`.  Downward: the extra `3^{4γ} ≤ 3`
gives `σ̄_{n+2}^2 ≤ 48 σ̄_n^2`, i.e. `σ̄_{n+2} ≤ 7 σ̄_n`.
