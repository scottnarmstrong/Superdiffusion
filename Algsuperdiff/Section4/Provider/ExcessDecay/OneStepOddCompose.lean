# Plumbing for the boundary producer: local identification and `EqOn` transfer

`OneStepOddValue` runs the boundary branch's Schauder producer from an
almost-everywhere odd competitor.  This module supplies the two pieces of
plumbing that producer needs once its datum is the **variationally** harmonic
`H¹` datum on the doubled window: the local identification of the two Weyl
representatives, and the transfer of the representative's two consumers along
the resulting `EqOn`.

## The local identification device

's `eqOn_of_ae_eq_of_continuous` needs *global* continuity, which no Weyl
representative has: harmonicity is asserted only on the window.  The local twin
`eqOn_of_ae_eq_of_continuousOn` is the same proof with `ContinuousOn` in place
of `Continuous`: on an open `S` the disagreement set is open, hence null
implies empty.  Continuity on the window comes from harmonicity for free
(`HarmonicAt` carries `ContDiffAt ℝ 2`), which is
`continuousOn_of_harmonicOnNhd`.

This settles the identification of the **two Weyl representatives** the boundary
branch produces: the interior route applies Weyl's lemma on the anchor's moved
replacement cube `R_mov`, the boundary route on the doubled window
`reflectedWindow`, and neither set contains the other — but both contain `U₂`,
both representatives are continuous there and both agree almost everywhere with
the competitor, so they agree *pointwise* on `U₂`
(two continuous harmonic representatives agreeing a.e. agree pointwise).  The
two consumers of the representative then transfer: `gradField` because `fderiv`
is local, and `affineExcess` because it is an integral over `U₂`
(`affineExcess_congr_eqOn`).
