# The discrete Grönwall inequality (`l.discrete.gronwall`)

ABK26, §4.3.  The source statement:

> Suppose `H ≥ 0`, `{ε̃_k}_{k=1}^i ⊂ ℝ₊` and `{a_k}_{k=1}^i` satisfy
> `a_l ≤ H + ∑_{k=1}^{l-1} ε̃_k a_k` for every `l ∈ {1,…,i}`.  Then
> `a_i ≤ H exp(∑_{k=1}^{i-1} ε̃_k)`.

and the printed proof is complete: with `S_l := ∑_{k≤l} ε̃_k a_k` one has `S_l
+ H ≤ (1 + ε̃_l)(S_{l-1} + H)`, hence `S_{i-1} + H ≤ H ∏_{k<i}(1 + ε̃_k)`, and
`1 + t ≤ e^t` finishes.  Both steps are reproduced here verbatim as
`gronwallProdBound` and `discrete_gronwall`.

## Reading conventions

* Indices run from `0` with `Finset.range`, so `∑_{k=1}^{l-1}` is
  `∑ k ∈ range l, ε k a k`.  This is a relabelling, not a change of content.
* The conclusion is proved for **every** `l ≤ N` simultaneously, which is what the
  telescoping argument gives for free and what the iteration lemma consumes (it
  feeds every `a_l` back into a sum).  `discrete_gronwall_top` is the source's
  literal single-index conclusion.
* **No sign hypothesis on `a`** is imposed, and none is needed: the proof only
  multiplies the hypothesis by `ε_l ≥ 0` and sums.  This matches the graph's own
  reading of the source hypotheses.
* The source writes `{ε̃_k} ⊂ ℝ₊` without saying whether `ℝ₊` is `[0,∞)` or
  `(0,∞)`; the recorded ambiguity is immaterial and the weaker `0 ≤ ε k` is used.

`Real.exp` is kept opaque throughout: the only transcendental input is
`Real.add_one_le_exp`, used once, and every other step is `ring`, an explicit
monotonicity lemma, or `linarith only`.

## Scope

`l.discrete.gronwall` is an unfrozen source node; this module is a provider
realization of its content and claims no node closure.
