# Attainment of the affine minimum `ℓ(u,W)` (the `min`/`argmin`)

`e.excess.def` writes the excess with a **`min`** over the affine functions and
names the minimizer `ℓ(u,W) = argmin`.  `AffineExcess.lean` defines the excess as
the `sInf` of the same competitor set.  This module supplies the attainment
statement --- the assertion that the `sInf` is a `min` --- by the direct method in
the `(d+1)`-dimensional affine parameter space `ℝ × Vec d`.

## What is proved, and on which class

`exists_isAffineMinimizer_of_nondegenerate` proves attainment on every window `W`
for which

* `u ∈ L²(W)` and every affine function is in `L²(W)` (`haff`), and
* the affine evaluation map is **two-sidedly nondegenerate** on `W`:
  `c₀‖(c,g)‖ ≤ ‖c + g·x‖_{L̲²(W)} ≤ K‖(c,g)‖` with `c₀ > 0` (`hlb`, `hub`).

That is exactly the hypothesis set the direct method needs: `hub` gives that the
competitor function is `K`-Lipschitz, hence continuous; `hlb` gives coercivity;
`ℝ × Vec d` is finite-dimensional, hence proper, so a continuous coercive function
attains a global minimum, and a global minimizer of the competitor function
realizes the `sInf`.

Note also that `hlb` *forces* `0 < |W|`.

## The residual, stated precisely (attainment on the consumption class)

The §4.3 consumption sites are **not** the source's "bounded domains": they are
the truncated windows `U_j = (x + □_j) ∩ □_m` and the abstract nested family of
`l.iteration.lemma`, whose only stated geometry is the sandwich `x + □_{j-2} ⊆
U_j ⊆ y + □_j` (hypothesis (iii), scoped to `j ≤ m` per the binding).  On such
a window `hlb`/`hub` are *theorems*, not assumptions, and the route is fixed
and known:

* `hub` follows from `W ⊆ y + □_j` and the crude bound
  `|c + g·x| ≤ |c| + |g| · diam`, since `‖·‖_{L̲²(W)}` of a bounded function is at
  most its sup;

Until it is proved, every §4.3 statement in this tree is phrased so that a
*chosen* minimizer's data `(c_j, g_j)` is **quantified**, never obtained from a
`choose` on an unavailable attainment: see `IterationLemma.lean`, whose slope
sequence `p` is a parameter and whose hypotheses are properties of the given
minimizers.

/-- **Attainment of the affine minimum, on a nondegenerate window.**

On a window carrying the two-sided affine nondegeneracy `hlb`/`hub` and on
which `u` is square-integrable, the infimum defining `affineExcessRaw` is
attained: some affine parameter pair `(c, g)` is an `IsAffineMinimizer`.  This
is the source's `min`/`argmin`, with the hypotheses the statement needs made
visible.  See the module docstring for the (false) hypothesis-free reading and
for the residual on the truncated consumption windows. -/
