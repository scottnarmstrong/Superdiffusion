# The anchored one-step delivered in the Step-4 / `IterationDecay` slot

The anchored interior one-step is the printed one-step contraction
with the harmonic-approximation anchor's four legs on the right.
`t.regularity` Step 4 and the frozen iteration anchor's own hypothesis
`e.Ej.decay.assumption` (named `IterationDecay` by the Step-5 provider) want
instead

```text
   E(u, U_{j-h}) ≤ θ^h E(u, U_j) + ε_j |∇ℓ_j| + δ_j ,   U_j = (z+□_j) ∩ □_m ,  θ = 3^{-1/4} .
```

This module performs that conversion — residues 1--4 — on the interior
branch.

## Residue 3: the `W' → U_0` window move, measured and closed at zero new analysis

In the proved indices the gap is exactly **one triadic scale**: the one-step at
scale `n` carries all four legs on `(z+□_{n+1}) ∩ □_m` and its supply event at
index `n+1` (the frozen statement's anchor is `z`-centred at its own index `+3`, two
scales above the print's `x`-centred `+1`), while its contraction reads the
excess at `(z+□_n) ∩ □_m`.

The move is therefore **not** an analytic comparison of two incomparable windows: it is a
re-index.  Running the one-step at `x := z` and reading the conclusion at `j := n+1`,

* the anchor's legs sit on `U_{n+1} = U_j` — the recursion's own window, where residue 2 applies
  verbatim, and the supply event sits at index `j`, which is exactly the index of the Step-3 bad
  set `𝓑_z = {j : 𝒢(j,z;·) fails}`;
* the contraction's excess sits on `U_n = U_{j-1}`, one scale below, and is
  moved up by the **proved** excess quasi-monotonicity `E(u,U_n) ≤ κ(d,1)
  E(u,U_{n+1})` (`OneStepWindows.affineExcess_truncatedWindow_le`, a pure
  volume-ratio bound), whose constant is absorbed into the contraction by
  residue 4;
* the left-hand window sits on `U_{n-k} = U_{j-h}` at `h := k+1`.

This module is the general-clause route, kept because it needs no
frontier-empty gate (hence covers the windows that meet `∂□_m`, where the
boundary join lives).

## What is discharged, and what is carried

Discharged inside: the anchor, the good-event cap
(`OneStepGoodScales.ae_errorRepresentative_le_goodEventDeltaSlot`), the
oscillation-to-excess fold, the window move, the contraction absorption, and
the almost-sure quantifier over the whole scale range (`ae_all_iff` over `ℤ`,
so that ONE `ω` serves every scale — what a pathwise bad set needs).

Carried, as source binders: the Dirichlet datum and clause-(iv) `MemLp` data of
the one-step; the harmonic replacement `v, w` on the moved cube at each scale
(the reflection chain plus the Weyl
representative produce them with no analytic input); the affine minimizer at
the scale in question; the interior gate `(z+□_{n-2}) ⊆ □_m`; and one smallness
gate on `δ`.

## The `δ`-gate (disclosed)

Printed Step 4 absorbs the one-step's second `E`-coefficient into `3^{-k/4}` by
the two inequalities (`C s^{-3/2} 3^{-k/4} ≤ 1/2` and `ε_j(z) ≤ ½ s^{3/2}
C^{-1} 3^{-k/4}`).  Here that absorption is a single explicit hypothesis
`hgate`: the capped leg constant times `s^{-3} δ^{1/2}` is at most `½ ·
3^{-(k+1)/4}`.
