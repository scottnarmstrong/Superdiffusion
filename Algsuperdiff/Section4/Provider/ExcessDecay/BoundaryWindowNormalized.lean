# The window norms in the anchor's volume-normalized carrier

The boundary window estimates are stated against CoarseGraining's own domain
measure `volume.restrict W'`, while the frozen statement prices every window
norm against the **volume-normalized** measure
`Support.normalizedVolumeMeasureOn W'`.  This file records the identity that
relates the two carriers: an `L²` norm against the normalized measure is the
restricted one times the scalar `(vol W')^{-1/2}`, which does not depend on the
function.  Since the boundary estimates are homogeneous — the *same* window on
both sides — that scalar cancels exactly and no constant changes.
