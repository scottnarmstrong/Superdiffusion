# The entry point, generalized off the literal `(1/2)`

**Strict additions.**  `OneStepGoodScales.le_of_indicator_goodEventAt_le` — the
development's single consumption point for the anchor's indicator — is stated
at the *literal* threshold `(1/2)`.  The general clause is gated at the
threshold `C⁻¹ s⁴` instead, so the `ε`-parametric form of that consumption
point is needed.  This module proves it, plus the two reachability
instantiations that make the development's own good-scale supply feed the new
event with no further analysis.

## What is general and what is instantiated

* `le_of_indicator_goodEventAt_le_of_le` is the entry point at **any** event
  threshold `ε_ev`, under the single side condition `0 ≤ ε ≤ ε_ev` relating the
  *supply* threshold `ε` (the one `hmem` is stated at) to the *display*
  threshold `ε_ev`.  The proved literal form is the instance `ε_ev = 1/2`, and
  `le_of_indicator_goodEventAt_le_recovered` re-derives it verbatim, so the
  generalization is strict and no consumer needs to change.
* `goodScaleSupply_subset_clauseEvent` and `minimalScaleSupply_subset_clauseEvent`
  are the two *set-level* reachability facts, at the excess-decay consumer's
  own supply `ε = (s/8)√δ` and at the minimal-scale anchor's `ε = s√δ`.
* `le_of_indicator_goodEventAt_le_regated` is the entry point at the frozen
  threshold `C⁻¹ s⁴`, consumed straight from the excess-decay consumer's supply
  under the **`δ` re-pricing** `δ ≤ 64 C⁻² s⁶`.

## The `δ` price, and why it costs nothing at the pin

The sole eventual consumer of `l.excess.decay.good.scales` pins `s = 1/4`, so
`64 C⁻² s⁶ = C⁻²/64` is a **constant**: the re-pricing is a constant tightening
of the `δ`-window, not a new `s`- or `γ`-dependence.  The `γ`-exponent and the
`1 − C γ^{1/2}` target are untouched.

A bound carried by the indicator of `𝒢(j,z; t, ε_ev)` holds pathwise at every
`ω` of `𝒢(j,z; t, ε)` as soon as `0 ≤ ε ≤ ε_ev` — the event only grows with its
threshold.  The proved form is the instance `ε_ev = 1/2`. -/
