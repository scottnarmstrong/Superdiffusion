# The `s`-envelope of the coarse-graining right-hand side at the §4.3 slot

## The slot

ABK26's `e.homogenization.L2.interior` is `p.general.coarse.graining` read at
`p = 2` and `m = n` — i.e. at **depth `j = 0`** — with the manuscript exponents
`(s_prop, s_1, s_2) = (s/2, s/4, s)`.

CoarseGraining's package asks `r < s_prop / 2` where the printed proposition
asks only `s_1 < s_prop`.  Keeping the printed error index `s_1 = s/4` (the
index the `q = 1 ← q = 2` comparison converts into the good event's own `s/8`)
therefore forces the comparison exponent **above** the printed `s/2`.

```text
   s_prop := 3s/4 ,      r := s/4 ,      r₂ := s ,      j := 0 ,
```

which satisfies every CoarseGraining hypothesis on the whole anchor range `s ∈
(0,1]` (`3s/4 < 1` even at the endpoint `s = 1`), keeps the printed
`𝓔_{s/4,∞,1}`, and costs only the harmless factor `4/3` on the `s_prop^{-1}`
prefactor: the comparison exponent enters CoarseGraining's right-hand side
**only** through `s_prop⁻¹`.

## The honest envelope (reported, not hidden)

The `s`-powers proved below are

| term | printed  | proved here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `𝓔 ·  ν^{1/2}‖∇u‖` | `C s^{-3/2}` | `(1024/3) s^{-4}` |
| forcing `[g]_{H̲^s}` | `C s^{-11/2}` | `(16384/3) s^{-6}` |

Both are *weaker* than the printed envelopes, so nothing here may be presented
as the printed display.  Two of the three forcing summands land on the printed
`s^{-11/2}` exactly; only the `|a₀| λ^{-1}_{r/2,2}` summand costs `s^{-6}`.

## The forcing bracket

The printed proposition writes the forcing prefactor as `(1 + 𝓔²_{s_1/2,∞,2})`;
CoarseGraining writes it through the coarse-grained ellipticity factors.  Both
are capped by `C(d)` on the good event `𝒢` — the first by
`e.good.set.giveth.v2`, the second by `e.bound.Lambdas.by.Es.v2` (the
`l.mathcal.E.to.Lambdas` leg proved in `LambdaCaps.lean`/`GoodEventCaps.lean`)
— so the two forms are interchangeable exactly where §4.3 uses them.
`coarseGrainingForceBracket` below is CoarseGraining's form, carried
explicitly.

/-- The energy term of `e.homogenization.L2.interior`, at depth `0`:
`|a₀|^{1/2} 𝓔_{r,∞,1}(Q; a, a₀) ‖∇u‖_{a,L̲²(Q)}`.  For the ABK operator
`a_L = ν Id + κ_L` with `κ_L` antisymmetric, the coefficient-energy norm on the
right *is* `ν^{1/2}‖∇u‖_{L̲²}`, which is what the display prints. -/
