# The boundary-regime energy estimate at the frozen theorem's own window

```text
  ν ⨍_{(x+□_{k-2})∩□_m} |∇u|²
      ≤ 3^d · [ 2 · P_{s,t} · λ_t 3^{-2k} ‖u(·+c) - v‖²_{L̲²(□_k)}
                + 2 · 18^d · ( C r^{-3/2} Λ⁻ [g̃]_{B^r}
                             + C r^{-1/2} Λ⁺ ‖∇h̃‖_{B^r} )² ] .
```

Everything on the left is the anchor's; everything on the right is
CoarseGraining's, at the covering cube `□_k` in its own frame, at the
translated sample `τ_c ω`, `c = wellPlacedCentre x m k`.  The comparison
solution `v` is *produced*, not assumed: it is the Dirichlet solution on `□_k`
carrying the transported boundary datum `h(·+c)`.

## Why the localized datum is the only possible hypothesis (disclosed)

At `Q = □_m` that is the anchor's own condition, but at `Q = □_m` the
Caccioppoli core is `□_m ∩ (w+□_{m-2})` and the covering ratio to the anchor's
window `x+□_n` is `3^{(m-2-n)d}`, which destroys the estimate.  That is the
content of `BoundaryOuterCaccioppoli`; here it is discharged.

## The `ν |∇u|²` reading

The antisymmetric flux shift leaves the symmetric part of the coefficient
untouched and the cutoff coefficient's symmetric part is `ν Id`
(`AntisymmetricShiftCutoff`), so CoarseGraining's `localizedCoeffEnergyValue`
at the flux-corrected family is literally `ν` times the normalized average of
`|∇u|²`.  The covering transport is therefore an *identity* on the integrand
and an inequality only in the volume ratio.
