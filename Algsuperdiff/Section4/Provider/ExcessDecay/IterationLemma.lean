# Iteration lemma, Step 3: crossing bad scales

ABK26, §4.3, `l.iteration.lemma`, Step 3.  The source concatenates the
good-run bound `e.E.and.grad.bound.good` across the maximal good intervals
of `([n,m] ∩ ℤ) ∖ B`, paying one factor per bad scale, and reaches
`e.combined.bound`; two endpoint comparisons then convert it into conclusion
(i), `e.iteration.slope.lemma`.

Both steps are proved here for abstract nonnegative sequences:

* `assembleRuns` --- the run concatenation, over an abstract nonnegative `q`;
* `combinedBound` --- `e.combined.bound` at `q = E + p`;
* `iterationSlopeBound` --- conclusion (i) in the oscillation form, from
  `combinedBound` plus the two endpoint comparisons supplied as an interface.

## The prefactor: the product form, and how it differs from the printed one

The source prints the prefactor of both `e.combined.bound` and
`e.iteration.slope.lemma` **additively**, as `exp(C h + C|B| + C∑ε)`.  What the
downward induction actually yields is the **product** form

```
(goodConst h κ Cstab · badConst κ Cstab) ^ (3|B ∩ [n,m]| + 3) · exp(goodRate · ∑ε),
```

and since `goodConst` grows like `h κ^h`, the exponent of the product form is
of order `h(|B| + 1)`, i.e. `exp(C h |B|)`, not `exp(C(h + |B|))`.  The two
shapes agree at the fixed `h` the lemma is used with (§4.4 pins `h := k ≥ 3`).

**This module therefore proves the product form and does not claim the printed
additive form.**  Deriving the additive form would need an argument that pays
the `h`-cost once rather than once per good run --- conceivable, because the
factor `iterM h κ` multiplies `E_b` only while `p_b` passes with coefficient
`1`, so an induction keeping the `E`- and `p`-components separate can hope to
hoist it --- but it is not attempted here.

## Reading choices, as implemented

* **The window cap.**  The window nesting/sandwich is demanded only for `j ≤
  m`.  The abstract hypotheses `hmono`/`hstab` are stated for all `k`, which is
  *stronger* than the argument needs and is the honest shape for abstract
  sequences; a consumer must honour the `j ≤ m` cap, and no
  statement in this module reads `E`, `p` at any index `> m`: the conclusions
  and all sums range over `[n,m]`, the decay hypothesis over `([n,m] ∩ ℤ) ∖ B`,
  and the lowest index reached is `n − h`.
* **The sandwich is not instantiated here.**  `κ` and `Cstab` are
  parameters, and `AffineExcess.lean`'s normalizer comparison is stated at the
  printed aspect ratio `3^{-2}`, never at the sharper `1/2`.
* **`h` and `θ` are data, not constants.**  They are explicit binders and appear in
  the conclusion through `iterM h κ` and through the gate `θ^h < 3/5`; no
  declaration hides them in an existential, and no constant here is existential.
* **`C` is quantified outermost, depending on `d`
  alone.**  Implemented literally: `goodConst`, `goodRate`, `badConst` are explicit
  `def`s of `h`, `κ`, `Cstab` only, so a consumer supplying `κ = κ(d)`,
  `Cstab = Cstab(d)` from the window geometry gets a constant uniform in
  `n, m, B, ε, δ, u`.
* **The family is used on `[n−h,m]` while the
  sums range over `[n,m]`.**  Implemented literally above.
* **`θ^{−C(h+|B|)}` versus `exp(C(h+|B|))`.**
  The two shapes are reconciled only through an undisplayed relation between
  `C` and `log(1/θ)`.
* **The `h`-gap is never weakened.**  The `h`-gap and the gate `θ^h < 3/5` are
  never replaced by an adjacent-scale contraction anywhere below.

## Scope

`hmono`, `hstab`, `hlo`, `hhi` are *hypotheses on abstract sequences* here, and
are the source's own Step-1/Step-3 **conclusions**; a consumer presenting these
theorems as `l.iteration.lemma` itself would be turning three proof obligations
into binders.

/-! ### The run concatenation -/

/-- **The abstract run concatenation** behind `e.combined.bound`.

Given a nonnegative sequence `q` that  grows by at most `Bc` per single scale
and (b) satisfies the length-independent good-run bound with constant `G` on
every all-good subinterval of `[n,m]`, the value at the bottom is controlled by
the value at the top with a prefactor depending on the *number* of bad scales
only.

The exponent `3|B ∩ [k,m]| + 3` is what the induction pays: at most one good-run
factor `G` and two single-scale factors `Bc` per bad scale crossed, plus the initial
run. -/

/-- **Conclusion (i) of `l.iteration.lemma`** (`e.iteration.slope.lemma`), in the
oscillation form and with the product prefactor.

The two endpoint comparisons --- which per the binding need *opposite* halves
of the affine window geometry and are not bare triangle inequalities --- enter
as the interface hypotheses `hlo`, `hhi`; they are the source's own Step-3
conclusions and must be discharged from the window sandwich at each use site,
never lifted as binders into a source-facing statement. -/
