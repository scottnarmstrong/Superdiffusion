# The `q = 1 ← q = 2` comparison of the homogenization error

This module proves the manuscript's own scale-exponent comparison
`e.compareEqs` (ABK26) at the endpoint pair `(q, p) = (1, 2)`:

```
𝓔_{s,∞,1}(Q; a, a₀)  ≤  𝓔_{s/2,∞,2}(Q; a, a₀) ,          s > 0 ,
```

with **no constant**.  The printed statement is
`𝓔_{s,∞,q} ≤ 𝓔_{sq/p,∞,p}` for `1 ≤ q ≤ p < ∞`; only the pair the §4.3 chain
uses is formalized here.

## Why this matters for §4.3

**The comparison is not missing from the manuscript**: `e.compareEqs`, proved
in Section 2 by Jensen's inequality immediately before `l.lambdas.stability`,
supplies it — and it proves on the index `s/8` rather than the printed `s/6`:

```
𝓔_{s/4,∞,1}(W)  ≤  𝓔_{s/8,∞,2}(W)          (this module, at `s := s/4`)
```

which is *exactly* the index at which the frozen annular anchor delivers its
cap.  So the printed intermediate rung `𝓔_{s/6,∞,2}` is removable, and with it
the only place where the §4.3 chain used `l.lambdas.stability` for an
index/exponent change.

Recorded deviation from print: the printed first inequality of
`e.good.set.giveth.v2` (`𝓔_{s/4,∞,1} ≤ C 𝓔_{s/6,∞,2}` at the *same* cube) is
**not** proved here and is not derivable from Jensen plus index monotonicity —
the index `s/6` is too large for the Jensen pairing and too small for
antitonicity.  It is true, by a weighted Cauchy--Schwarz with an absolute
constant, but it is not needed: the route through `s/8` reaches the same
endpoint with constant `1`.

## The proof, in one line

Both sides are the same weighted series, because the weights agree:

```
w_{s,1}(l) = (1 − 3^{-s}) 3^{-sl} = w_{s/2,2}(l),
𝓔_{s,∞,1}   = ∑_l w_{s,1}(l) · Rₗ,        𝓔_{s/2,∞,2}² = ∑_l w_{s,1}(l) · Rₗ² ,
```

and `∑_l w_{s,1}(l) = 1`.  With `A := 𝓔_{s/2,∞,2}` the pointwise inequality
`2 A Rₗ ≤ Rₗ² + A²` (i.e. `0 ≤ (Rₗ − A)²`) summed against the unit-mass weights
gives `∑ w R ≤ (A² + A²)/(2A) = A`.  No Cauchy--Schwarz machinery is needed.

/-- **The manuscript's `e.compareEqs` at the endpoint pair `(q, p) = (1, 2)`.**

```
𝓔_{s,∞,1}(Q; a, a₀)  ≤  𝓔_{s/2,∞,2}(Q; a, a₀) .
```

Same cube, same coefficient family, same comparator, no constant: only the
scale-exponent and the index move, and they move together (`s ↦ s/2` when
`q = 1 ↦ 2`), which is exactly Jensen's inequality for the unit-mass geometric
weights.

At `s := s/4` this reads `𝓔_{s/4,∞,1} ≤ 𝓔_{s/8,∞,2}`, i.e. it converts the
`q = 1` quantity of the coarse-graining display `e.homogenization.L2.interior`
into the `q = 2` quantity at the annular anchor's own index `s/8`. -/
