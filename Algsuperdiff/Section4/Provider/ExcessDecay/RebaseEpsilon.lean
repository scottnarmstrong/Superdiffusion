# The clause-threshold calculus

**Conditional-free provider helpers, not a node realization.**  Everything in
this module is arithmetic on the frozen good-event threshold `ε = C⁻¹ s⁴`
together with the *proved* `ε`-monotonicity of the good event
(`GoodEvents.goodEventAt_mono_ep`).  No analysis, no measure theory beyond a
`Set.indicator` rewrite.

Exactly two literals of the frozen statement read `C⁻¹ s⁴` rather than `(1/2)`,
at the statement's own existential constant:

* the hoisted `γ`-smallness funding line;
* the *general* clause's good-event threshold.

The interior clause's event stays at `(1/2)`.  Both read the same way, so
passing from the `(1/2)` form to the `C⁻¹ s⁴` form is a **pure weakening**; the
four lemmas of §1--§3 are exactly the two directions that weakening needs, and
§5 is the consumer-side re-pricing that lets the development's own good-scale
supply `ε = (s/8)√δ` (and the minimal-scale anchor's `ε = s√δ`) reach the
threshold.

/-- The frozen threshold is nonnegative — the left half of the proved
`goodEventAt_mono_ep` side condition. -/

    0 ≤ C⁻¹ * s ^ (4 : ℕ) :=
  mul_nonneg (inv_pos.mpr hC).le (pow_nonneg hs 4)

/-- The frozen threshold is at most `1/2`, as soon as the
statement's own existential constant is at least `2` and `s ≤ 1`. -/
theorem clauseEpsilon_le_half {C s : ℝ} (hC : 2 ≤ C) (hs : 0 ≤ s) (hs1 : s ≤ 1) :

  have hpone : s ^ (4 : ℕ) ≤ 1 := pow_le_one₀ hs hs1
  have hone : C⁻¹ * C = 1 := inv_mul_cancel₀ (ne_of_gt hCpos)
  have htwo : C⁻¹ * 2 ≤ 1 := by

    _ = C⁻¹ := mul_one _
    _ ≤ 1 / 2 := hhalf

/-- The threshold is **antitone** in the constant: raising `C` shrinks the
clause event.  This is the whole reason a joint constant `max _ _` can be handed
to a producer stated at its own smaller constant. -/
theorem clauseEpsilon_anti {C C' s : ℝ} (hC : 0 < C) (hCC : C ≤ C') (hs : 0 ≤ s) :

  mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (inv_anti₀ hC hCC) (pow_nonneg hs 4)

/-! ## 2. The funding back-port -/

/-- **The back-port.**  The anchor's hoisted `γ`-smallness line is *monotone* in
its trailing `ε` factor, so funding at the smaller `C⁻¹ s⁴` threshold funds every
larger one — in particular the literal `(1/2)` and the producer's own
`C₀⁻¹ s⁴`.

This is `DirectionProbe`'s `hfund'` step, isolated. -/

/-- The standing regime hypothesis is back-ported the same way: it reads `C⁻¹`
directly, and `C ≤ C'` makes the `C'` form the stronger one. -/

/-! ## 3. The event and its indicator -/

/-- **The domination.**  A proved indicator display at the larger threshold
dominates the clause-threshold one pointwise: the clause event is the smaller
set, and the indicated function is `ℝ≥0∞`-valued.

(Stated here at a general pair of thresholds and with no import of any
`Frozen/` statement file.) -/

    Set.indicator (Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section4.goodEventAt M Ccg j y t ep) F omega ≤

  Set.indicator_le_indicator_of_subset
    (Algsuperdiff.Section4.Provider.GoodEvents.goodEventAt_mono_ep M Ccg j y t hep0 hep)
    (fun _ => zero_le _) omega

/-- **The slot transfer at a witnessed `ω`.**

An indicator bound at *one* threshold `ε₁` transfers to *any* other threshold
`ε₂`, provided the sample `ω` is known to sit in the good event at a threshold
`ε` below both.  Off the event an indicator is `0`; at a witnessed `ω` both
indicators collapse to the same value `F ω`, so the transfer is free in **both**
directions.

This is the mechanism that turns every proved `(1/2)`-gated `hharm` binder into
its `C⁻¹ s⁴`-gated sibling, and back: the consumer always carries `hmem`. -/

/-! ## 4. The general clause's bracket -/

/-- Nonnegativity of the frozen general clause's four-summand bracket, stated
abstractly in the legs (so it is blind to every `s`-exponent the freeze moved).
In-repo public sibling of the join lane's private bracket helper. -/

the assembly's joint constant.  In-repo sibling of `RebaseJoin`'s
`private four_summand_absorb`. -/

/-! ## 5. The `δ` re-pricing -/

/-- `√t ≤ a` from `t ≤ a²` at nonnegative `a` — the only square-root step the
re-pricing needs. -/
theorem sqrt_le_of_le_sq {a t : ℝ} (ha : 0 ≤ a) (h : t ≤ a ^ (2 : ℕ)) :
    Real.sqrt t ≤ a := by

  rwa [Real.sqrt_sq ha] at h1

/-- **The excess-decay consumer's supply reaches the clause event.**

The development's good-scale supply is `ε = (s/8)√δ` (the printed
good-event-cap slot).  It sits below the frozen threshold exactly when `δ
≤ (8 C⁻¹ s³)²`. -/

/-- **The consumer's `δ` price, written out.**

`δ ≤ 64 C⁻² s⁶` is `(8 C⁻¹ s³)²` written out; at that price the good-scale
supply feeds the general clause with no further analysis. -/
theorem excessDecayDelta_repriced {C s delta : ℝ} (hC : 0 < C) (hs : 0 ≤ s)
    (hdelta : delta ≤ 64 * (C ^ (2 : ℕ))⁻¹ * s ^ (6 : ℕ)) :

  ring

/-- **The minimal-scale anchor's slot reaches the clause event.**

The minimal-scale anchor carries the tolerance `ε = s√δ`; it sits below the
frozen threshold exactly when `δ ≤ (C⁻¹ s³)²`. -/
theorem minimalScaleEpsilon_le_clauseEpsilon {C s delta : ℝ} (hC : 0 < C) (hs : 0 ≤ s)
    (hdelta : delta ≤ (C⁻¹ * s ^ (3 : ℕ)) ^ (2 : ℕ)) :

  ring

/-- **Exactness at that choice of `δ`.**  At `δ := (C⁻¹ s³)²` the minimal-scale
tolerance `s√δ` *equals* the frozen threshold `C⁻¹ s⁴`, so the reach is sharp,
not slack. -/
theorem minimalScaleEpsilon_eq_clauseEpsilon {C s : ℝ} (hC : 0 < C) (hs : 0 ≤ s) :
