# The consumer-side budget of the general clause's right-hand side

The general clause consumed here carries `‖u − h‖_{L̲²(W')}` in its first
bracket leg and `s^{-6}` on legs 4 and 5, in place of the plain mean-subtracted
norm `‖u − (u)_{W'}‖_{L̲²(W')}` and the exponent `s^{-9/2}`.

At the excess-decay application (`OneStepConditional.
excessDecay_oneStep_of_harmonicApprox`, instance `n := n-2`,
`x := wellPlacedCentre x m (n-2)`) the clause's right-hand side is received as
the abstract `B`, and the excess-decay display multiplies `B.toReal` by
`triangleRemainderConst d Csch k * (3^{-n} * √((3^2)^d))`.  So every leg must
survive multiplication by `3^{-n}` into the excess-decay conclusion shape.  This
module proves what **does** survive; what does not is treated in
`OneStepConsumerRefutation`.

## What is proved here

* §1 **The `s^{-9/2} → s^{-6}` exponent move is a weakening, and it is
  invisible to the proved chain.**  `rpow_neg_nine_halves_le_rpow_neg_six`: for
  `0 < s ≤ 1`, `s^{-9/2} ≤ s^{-6}`, so the `s^{-6}` right-hand side dominates
  the `s^{-9/2}` one leg for leg.  At the sole eventual pin `s = 1/4`
  (`Regularity.MinimalScaleShift.stepOneS`) both exponents are numerals,
  `4^{9/2} = 512` and `4^6 = 4096` — a factor `8`, absorbed into `C(d,c⋆)`.
* §2 **The good-event collapse.**
  `rpow_neg_four_mul_goodEventCap_le_rpow_neg_six`: the clause's flux prefactor
  `s^{-4}` against the proved cap `𝓔·1_𝒢 ≤ C s δ^{1/2}` (`OneStepGoodScales.
  ae_errorRepresentative_le_goodEventDeltaSlot`) collapses to `s^{-3}δ^{1/2}`,
  which is below the clause's own `s^{-6}` for every `0 < s ≤ 1`, `δ ≤ 1`.
* §3 **The conditional absorption lemma** — the exact shape the `B`-expansion
  needs for the new first leg, on the **boundary branch**:
  `dataSubtracted_leg_absorbed_of_flatGradientBound`.  **The `hGu` slot — a
  bound on the flat window gradient `∑ᵢ ‖∂ᵢu‖_{L̲²(W')}` — has no producer**
  and is carried as an open hypothesis.
* §4 **The `∇h` half is free.**  `gradH_half_eq_leg5_contribution`: the datum
  half of §3's bound is *equal* to `9·C_cap·C_poin` times the clause's own
  fifth leg after the excess-decay `3^{-n}`, at the exponent `s^{-6}`.  So the
  datum half of the new leg costs nothing beyond a `d`-constant.
