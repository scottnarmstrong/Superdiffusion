# The family bridge: the two `ã_{L,m}` carriers at the *block* response level

Nothing here imports that file, and nothing here claims the anchor.

## The gap this closes

The Step-1 endpoint of `Step1ScaleSum.lean` (and hence the whole Step-1/Step-2
chain, and hence the object the a.e.-fidelity certificate of
`TwoScaleFidelity.lean` puts under the anchor's `lintegral`) is written at the
Chapter 4 dependent family of the flux-corrected carrier field,

* `Support.fluxCorrectedCoeffFamily M L m (□_m) ω`,

through the *block* response maximum `Ch02.normalizedBlockResponseMax`.  Step 3
(`Step3HSlot.lean`) speaks instead at the hand-built family

* `Annular.subConstCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily M L (k_L − k_m)_{□_m} … ω`,

because that is the family the proved §4.1 response transport and the Section
2.4 sensitivity anchor consume.

`Annular.CarrierIdentification` connects the two families at ONE cube and at the
`scalarResponseMax` level.  What the Step-1 endpoint needs is the *family*-level
a.e. equality, which upgrades the identification to every object of the Chapter 2
`𝓔`-tower — in particular to `normalizedBlockResponseMax`, the per-cube object of
the endpoint's inner average.  That upgrade is supplied here.

## The route: no new mathematics

`Ch02.TriadicCoeffFamily.A is *defined* as the a.e. equality of the cube
representatives triadic cube, and the proof of
`Annular.fluxCorrectedCoeffFamily_coeffOn_aeeq_subConstCutoff` never looks at
its cube: both `toCoeffField` values reduce definitionally to `x ↦ a_L(x) −
(k_L − k_m)_{□_m}`.  So the same four lines give the family-level statement,
and then CoarseGraining's own a.e.-invariance layer
(`Ch02.normalizedBlockResponseMax_eq_ofA, `Ch02.scaleResponseAtScale_eq_ofA,
`Ch02.HomogenizationError_eq_ofA) transports every level of the tower with no
further work.

## Main results

* `fluxCorrectedCoeffFamily_aeEq_subConstFluxFamily` — the family-level a.e.
  equality of the two `ã_{L,m}` carriers.
* `normalizedBlockResponseMax_fluxCorrected_eq` — **the missing congruence**: the
  per-cube block response maximum of the endpoint is the per-cube block response
  maximum at the family Step 3 speaks, at every cube and every comparator.
* `finsetAverage_rpow_normalizedBlockResponseMax_fluxCorrected_eq` — the same for
  the endpoint's inner `p/2`-average over descendants, verbatim in the shape
  `Step1ScaleSum.step1_scaleSum_endpoint_originCube` produces.
* `homogenizationError_fluxCorrected_eq` — the same for the two-argument
  `(∞, 2)` error itself, i.e. for the object the a.e.-fidelity certificate names.

/-- **The family-level form of A6c finding (f).**  The Chapter 4 dependent family
of the flux-corrected carrier field and the hand-built family of
`a_L − (k_L − k_m)_{□_m}` are a.e. equal **as triadic coefficient families**:
their cube representatives agree at every triadic cube.

This is `Annular.fluxCorrectedCoeffFamily_coeffOn_aeeq_subConstCutoff` with its
cube quantified, which its proof already supports: both `toCoeffField` values
reduce definitionally to `x ↦ a_L(x) − (k_L − k_m)_{□_m}`. -/
