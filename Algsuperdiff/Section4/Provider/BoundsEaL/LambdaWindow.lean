# The `s`-window of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` at `s = γ`, discharged

## The obligation this module removes

`Proportion.exists_cgExcess_atomTail` and the (B5) statements of
`LambdaSlotB5.lean` carry ONE undischarged premise, the anchor's own `s`-window
read at `s = γ`:

```
cgTailScale M E = exp(−(C_cg^{−1} E^{−2} γ^{−1}))  ≤  γ/2 .
```

This module formalizes that note at the budget `E = C c⋆^{−1}` actually
supplied, in the anchor's OWN regime `γ ≤ C^{−10} c⋆^{10}`.

## The arithmetic, in full

Write `r := c⋆/C`, so that `E^{−1} = r` and the regime reads `γ ≤ r^{10}`.  With
`K := C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)}` and `S := √(γ^{−1}) ≥ 1`:

* `S ≥ r^{−5}` (square both sides of `γ ≤ r^{10}`);
* `K^{−1} r² γ^{−1} = (K^{−1} r² S) S ≥ (K^{−1} r^{−3}) S ≥ 3 S`, the last step
  being exactly the hypothesis `3 K r³ ≤ 1`;
* `log(2/γ) = log 2 + log(S²) ≤ 1 + 2(S − 1) ≤ 3S`.

Hence `K^{−1} r² γ^{−1} ≥ log(2/γ)`, which is the window.  The hypothesis
`3 K r³ ≤ 1` is met by ANY constant `C ≥ max{6, K}`: `c⋆ ≤ 3/2` gives
`r ≤ (3/2)C^{−1}`, so `3 K r³ ≤ (81/8) K C^{−3}`, and `C ≥ 6` gives
`C³ ≥ 36 C ≥ 36 K ≥ (81/8) K`.  No `γ`-exponent and no `s`-power is moved: the
regime and the amplitude are the printed ones.

Only natural powers, `Real.sqrt`, `Real.log` and `Real.exp` appear; every
transcendental atom is kept opaque (no `nlinarith` anywhere).

There is a dimensional constant `C` such that every model in the printed regime
`γ ≤ C^{−10}c⋆^{10}` has, at the budget `E = C c⋆^{−1}`, for every `k ∈ ℤ` and
every real centre `z`,

```
( σ̄_{k−3} λ_{γ,2}^{-1}(z+□_{k−2}; 𝐚_{k−2}) − C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)} )_+
  ≤ 𝒪_{Γ_{1/3}} ( exp(−(C_cg C²)^{−1} c⋆² γ^{−1}) ) ,
```

with NO remaining hypothesis.  The constant is the proved one raised to
`C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)}`, which is what makes the window self-discharging. -/
