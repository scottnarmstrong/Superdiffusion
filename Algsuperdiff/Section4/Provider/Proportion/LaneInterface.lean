# The three-lane interface of the `§4.1` proportion assembly

ABK26, §4.1, `p.independence.between.scales`.  The proof of that proposition
splits `𝟙{𝒢(m; s, ε)ᶜ}` into the three constituent complements and applies each
lane's ratio lemma "with `θ` replaced by `θ/3`".  This module is the *interface*
of that step:

* `LaneTail M Ev θ c₁` — the common endpoint shape of one lane: at **every**
  window `{0,…,n}` the density of scales at which `Ev` fails exceeds `θ` with
  probability at most `exp(−c₁n)/3`.  It is exactly the conclusion shape the
  `𝒢₀` lane (`RatioTailClosed`) and the `𝒢₁` lane
  (`G1RatioTail`/`G1ThresholdArith`) deliver.
* `scaleProp_add_scaleProp_compl` — the complementarity
  `avsum 𝟙{𝒢} + avsum 𝟙{𝒢ᶜ} = 1` of the good and bad scale densities, which
  converts a bad-density endpoint into the frozen display's good form.

/-! ## 1. The common lane endpoint -/

/-- **The shape of one lane's ratio-tail endpoint.**  `LaneTail M Ev θ c₁` says
that for every window `{0,…,n}` — including the short windows `n < r` that
`p.concentration.for.scales` does not itself reach (covered inside the proved
`ratioTail_of_concentration`) — the density of scales at which `Ev` fails
exceeds `θ` with probability at most `exp(−c₁n)/3`.

The prefactor `1/3` is the union-bound share of the three-lane split: three
lanes at `exp(−c₁n)/3` recombine to `exp(−c₁n)`. -/
