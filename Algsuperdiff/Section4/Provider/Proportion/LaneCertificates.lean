# The frozen-anchor bridge arithmetic of the two lane couplings

ABK26, §4.1.  The `𝒢₀` and `𝒢₁` ratio-tail lanes are unconditional in
everything probabilistic; what each still needs is one explicit inequality
tying the model to the level `θ` and the rate `c₁`:

* `𝒢₀`: `C⁹γ² ≤ θ c⋆⁸` — the level-vs-regime coupling that replaces the proved
  `RatioTailClosed` packaging of `θ` *inside* the constant
  (`couplingG0_of_anchor`);
* `𝒢₁`: `K(d,r)(1+c₁)γ ≤ θ c⋆ s⁶ ε²` — the closed form of `T₀ ≤ s ε √c⋆
  γ^{-1/2}` at the substituted threshold of `e.lambda.good.events`
  (`couplingG1_of_anchor`).

Both are abstract-real implications recording what the frozen proportion
anchor's own parameter clauses give.  The anchor quantifies one constant `C_a`
before `(M, s, ε, θ)` and carries the regime `γ ≤ C_a^{-1}c⋆^{10}` together with
the level clause `C_a c⋆^{-2}s^{-4}ε^{-2}γ ≤ θ`; `regime_of_anchor` reads the
printed regime off that one.
