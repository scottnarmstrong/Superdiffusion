# Translated-cube locality of the multiscale-ellipticity literal

ABK26, §4.1, `l.good.scales.ratio.lambda`, the two-dependence step: the per-scale
atoms `𝒴_n` are asserted to be `2`-dependent.  The independence producer
consumes that assertion as *locality*: `𝒴_n` must be measurable for the
integral-local information `Cutoff.cutoffSampleLocalSigma M (n−2)
(annulusRegion d n)` of the annulus it reads.  This module supplies that
locality, unconditionally.

## The bridge

The `𝒢₀` atom is written by translating the *sample*, never the cube:

```
λ_{γ,2}^{-1}(z+□_j; a_c)  :=  cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral M j c γ 2
                                 (translateCutoffSample z ω) ,
```

while the proved locality statement
`BadEvents.measurable_cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_cutoffSampleLocal` is
about the *cube* reading `cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral M Q c γ 2 ω` at a
genuine `TriadicCube Q`.  The two are identified by the proved pathwise swap
`BadEvents.cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_translateCutoffSample`, whose
mathematical content is the Chapter 2 translation covariance
`BadEvents.lambdaSq_cutoff_translateCutoffSample` of the actual coefficient
cutoff.

The decisive point is that the centres occurring in §4.1 are **triadic lattice
points** `z = 3^j v`, so `z + □_j` *is* the triadic cube `⟨j, v⟩`
(`Localize.latticeCube`, whose `triadicCubeShift` is `Support.triadicLatticePoint`).
No σ-algebra on a translated region, and no translated-region bookkeeping, is
needed: the cube reading is available at the honest cube, and the locality
lemma applies to it verbatim.  Arbitrary real translates `z` are *not* covered
and are not needed anywhere in §4.1.

## The chain

1. `cubeSet_latticeCube_subset_annulusRegion` — the geometry: a lattice cube
   `3^j v + □_j` whose centre lies in the open annulus `□_n ∖ □_{n−1}` has its
   whole (half-open) realization inside `annulusRegion d n`, for `j ≤ n−1`.
   This is the proved no-enlargement fact
   `Probability.mem_annulusRegion_of_le_triadicLatticePoint`, read at the cube.
2. `cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_translateCutoffSample_latticeCube` — the
   core identity, in the orientation the Section 4 carriers need.
3. `measurable_cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_translate_cutoffSampleLocal` —
   the general export: the translated-sample reading of the `λ`-literal at the
   lattice cube `⟨j, v⟩`, at cutoff level `c`, is
   `cutoffSampleLocalSigma M m U`-measurable for every `U ⊇ cubeSet ⟨j, v⟩` and
   every `m ≥ c`.  The domain scale `j` and the cutoff scale `c` are
   independent parameters, so the `𝒢₂` reading `z + □_n` at `a_{n−2}` is
   covered as well.
4. `measurable_cgExcess_annulusRegion_local`,
   `measurable_annMax_annulusRegion_local`,
   `measurable_Ycal_annulusRegion_local` — the `𝒢₀` instances, ending at the
   `hloc` slot of `columnsIndep_Ycal`.

## The corrected reduction (recorded)

`Concentration.measurable_Ycal_local` reduces the `𝒴`-locality to a per-cube
slot quantified over **every** index vector `v : Fin d → ℤ`.  That slot is not
dischargeable, and not because of a missing lemma: a cube `3^{k−2}v + □_{k−2}`
with `v` outside the annulus enumeration is genuinely not read by
`annulusRegion d n`.  The `0`-floored maximum only ever evaluates the bracket on
`latticeAnnulusFinset d (k−2) n (n−1)`, so the honest reduction quantifies over
the members of that `Finset`; that is `measurable_Ycal_local_of_annulusFinset`
below, on top of the restricted `measurable_fmax_of_mem`.  Both readings are
recorded here; the endpoint delivered is unconditional either way.

## Scope

Provider material: proved local helpers.  Every statement is pointwise in the
sample; nothing is `a.e.` and no hypothesis is added to any consumer.

/-! ## 1. The geometry: a lattice cube of the annulus stays in the annulus -/

/-- **The read cube sits inside the annulus region.**  If the lattice point
`3^j v` lies in the open triadic annulus `□_n ∖ □_{n−1}` and `j ≤ n − 1`, then
the entire half-open realization of the triadic cube `⟨j, v⟩ = 3^j v + □_j` is
contained in `annulusRegion d n`.

This is the cube-level reading of the proved no-enlargement fact
`Probability.mem_annulusRegion_of_le_triadicLatticePoint`: the cubes read by
the per-scale atom *tile* the annulus and do not stick out of it, so no
fattening of the observation region — and hence no degradation of the
separation count — is incurred. -/

/-! ## 2. The core identity at a triadic lattice point -/

/-- **The translated-sample reading is the translated-cube reading.**

```
λ_{s,q}^{-1}(□_j ; a_c(τ_{3^j v} ω))  =  λ_{s,q}^{-1}(3^j v + □_j ; a_c(ω)) ,
```

i.e. the `λ`-functional of the translated field on the centred cube equals the
functional of the field on the translated cube.  This is the proved pathwise
swap `BadEvents.cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_translateCutoffSample` read at
the lattice cube `⟨j, v⟩`, whose base point is `Support.triadicLatticePoint j
v` and whose scale is `j`; its own content is the Chapter 2 translation
covariance of the actual coefficient cutoff.  It holds at every sample point,
for every cutoff level `c` and every admissible exponent, with no hypothesis. -/

/-! ## 3. The general locality export -/

/-- **The `λ`-literal read at a translated cube is integral-local.**

For a triadic lattice centre `z = 3^j v`, an observation region `U` containing
the closed cube `z + □_j`, and any shell index `m` at or above the cutoff level
`c`, the translated-sample reading

```
ω ↦ λ_{s,q}^{-1}(z + □_j ; a_c(ω))  =  (cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral M j c s q)
                                          (translateCutoffSample z ω)
```

is `Cutoff.cutoffSampleLocalSigma M m U`-measurable.

Nothing is `a.e.`: the literal is the genuinely measurable observable, and the
locality is the proved
`BadEvents.measurable_cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_cutoffSampleLocal`, whose
descendant tree never leaves the closed cube.  The domain scale `j` and the
cutoff level `c` are independent, so this covers the `𝒢₀` reading (`j = c`) and
the `𝒢₂`-style reading (`c = j − 2`) alike. -/

/-! ## 4. The `𝒢₀` bracket at an annulus centre -/

/-- **The `𝒢₀` bracket at a lattice centre of the annulus is local.**  For a
centre enumerated by `Support.latticeAnnulusSet d j n (n−1)` with `j ≤ n − 2`,
the excess `𝒳_j(3^j v)` is measurable for the integral-local information of
`annulusRegion d n` at shell index `n − 2`.

The scale hypothesis `j ≤ n − 2` is exactly what the `𝒢₀` lane supplies
(`j = k − 2` with `k ≤ n`): it gives both the geometric room `j ≤ n − 1` and the
shell-index comparison the local σ-field needs. -/

/-! ## 5. The annulus maximum -/

/-- **Measurability of the `0`-floored maximum from the members alone.**  The
proved `measurable_fmax` asks for measurability of *every* index; the maximum
only ever evaluates the members of `S`, and that is all the §4.1 lattice maxima
can supply (a centre outside the annulus enumeration reads a cube the annulus
does not contain). -/

      exact (((hf i (Finset.mem_insert_self i S)).max measurable_const).max
        (ih fun j hj => hf j (Finset.mem_insert_of_mem hj)))

/-- **The annulus maximum of the `𝒢₀` bracket is local.**  For `k ≤ n` the
maximum over `3^{k−2}ℤ^d ∩ (□_n ∖ □_{n−1})` is measurable for the integral-local
information of `annulusRegion d n` at shell index `n − 2`. -/

/-! ## 6. The `𝒴`-locality: the `hloc` slot of the concentration lane -/

/-- **The corrected per-cube reduction.**  `𝒴_n` is local as soon as the `𝒢₀`
bracket is local at each centre the annulus maxima actually enumerate.  The
quantifier ranges over the members of `latticeAnnulusFinset d (k−2) n (n−1)`,
which is what the `0`-floored maximum reads; quantifying over all
`v : Fin d → ℤ` (as `Concentration.measurable_Ycal_local` does) asks for
locality at cubes the annulus does not contain, and is not dischargeable. -/

    (hatomloc : ∀ k : ℤ, k ≤ n → ∀ v ∈ latticeAnnulusFinset d (k - 2) n (n - 1),

  refine measurable_wsum fun j => ?_
  exact measurable_fmax_of_mem _ fun v hv => hatomloc (n - (j : ℤ)) (by omega) v hv

/-- **`𝒴_n` is local — unconditionally.**  This is the `hloc` slot of
`columnsIndep_Ycal` and of `ratioTail_Ycal`: the `𝒢₀` score field at index `n`
is measurable for the integral-local information
`cutoffSampleLocalSigma M (n−2) (annulusRegion d n)` of the annulus it reads.

Together with `Probability.separatedBy_annulusRegion_of_gap` this is the honest
content's one-line `2`-dependence assertion: the atoms are measurable for
regions that are separated at the shared-shell threshold, which is exactly what
`iIndepFun_of_local_cutoffSample` consumes. -/
theorem measurable_Ycal_annulusRegion_local (M : ABKModel d) (Ccg sprime : ℝ) (n : ℤ) :
    Measurable[Cutoff.cutoffSampleLocalSigma M (n - 2) (annulusRegion d n)]
