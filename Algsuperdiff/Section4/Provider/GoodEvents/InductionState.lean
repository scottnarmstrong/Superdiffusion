# The all-scales induction state `𝒮(m, C c⋆⁻¹)`

Section 4 consumes the Section 3 induction state `𝒮(m₀, E)` as a *premise* at
half a dozen call sites: `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` and `e.shom.m.vs.shom.n`
both carry `𝒮(m₀−1, E)` together with a budget gate `E ≥ C c⋆⁻¹` and a regime
`γ ≤ E⁻¹¹⁰`, and §4.1 applies them at arbitrary scales without ever exhibiting
the state.  The manuscript's discharge is the last two lines of the proof of
`p.induction.bounds`:

> According to Proposition `p.base.case`, there exists `C(d) < ∞` such that
> `𝒮(m**, C c⋆^{−1/2})` is valid.  By induction, we deduce the existence of
> `C(d) < ∞` such that `𝒮(m, C c⋆⁻¹)` is valid for every `m ∈ ℤ`.

This module renders those two lines over the Section 3 surface.

## The `c⋆^{−1/2}` to `c⋆⁻¹` reconciliation

Both halves are proved in this repository, so **the gap is closed here, not
assumed**:

* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Induction.inductionState_mono_E` — the frozen
  state is monotone in `E` (both `E`-occurrences of the frozen definition are
  increasing in `E`); and

Together they give `Cstart c⋆^{−1/2} ≤ C c⋆⁻¹` as soon as `C ≥ Cstart √(3/2)` —
the proved `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Induction.startBudget_le_of_sqrt`.

## What is consumed

* the proved state calculus of `Section3/Provider/Induction/StateCalculus.lean`
  (`inductionState_mono_E`, `inductionState_of_base_of_step_of_E_le`,
  `startBudget_le_of_sqrt`) and `cstar_le_three_halves`.

`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.induction_bounds` is *not* consumed: its proof
builds exactly this state internally (`InductionBoundsAssembly.lean`) but does
not export it, and its own conclusion does not carry the state.  The assembly
here therefore repeats the constant bookkeeping rather than importing a
`private` helper or editing Section 3.

/-- **The all-scales induction state, with a caller-prescribed constant floor.**

For every requested threshold `C₀` there is a `C ≥ max 6 C₀`, depending only on
the dimension and on `C₀`, such that every model in the printed regime
`γ ≤ C⁻¹¹⁰ c⋆¹⁰` admits the budget `E = C c⋆⁻¹`, and `𝒮(m, E)` holds at
*every* integer scale.  The returned bundle also carries the three `E`-side
facts the Section 4 call sites need (see §3).

The `C₀` slot is what makes the result usable: a downstream node with its own
constant `C'` gets `C' c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` from `mul_cstarInv_le_of_budget` by requesting
`C₀ := C'`. -/

/-! ## 3. The `E`-window consumption A

The Section 4 call sites do not consume `𝒮` alone: `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`
(as `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds`) asks for `max
(exp (Ccg/σ)) c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` and `E ≤ γ^{−1/5}` on top of the state, and
`e.shom.m.vs.shom.n` asks for `C' c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` and `γ ≤ E⁻¹¹⁰`.  Each of the
budget-side facts is discharged from the budget identity `(E : ℝ) = C c⋆⁻¹`. -/

/-- **Any constant below the budget constant clears the budget gate.**  This is the
premise `E ≥ C' c⋆⁻¹` of `e.shom.m.vs.shom.n` and of the `induction_step`, at a
downstream node's own constant `C'`. -/
