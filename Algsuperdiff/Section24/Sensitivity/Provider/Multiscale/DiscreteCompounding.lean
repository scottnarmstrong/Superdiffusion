# Discrete compounding arithmetic for the Section 2.4 sensitivity estimates

The manuscript's Section 2.4 sensitivity proofs are written as differential
inequalities in the segment parameter `t` for `a + t h`.  The aggregate
coarse-grained quantities `lambda_{s,q}^{-1}` and `Lambda_{s,q}` are infinite
weighted aggregates of finite maxima of one-cube observables, so they are
*not* classically differentiable in `t`, and no such regularity may be
assumed.  Every `t`-derivative step of the source is therefore replaced here
by a purely discrete compounding argument along the path `a + (k/N) h`, `k =
0, …, N`.

This module contains only the gauge-free real-analysis arithmetic behind that
replacement:

* `riccati_step_le` — the discrete replacement for integrating the Riccati
  inequality `y' ≤ K y²` obtained at the self-referential gauge
  `(s,q) = (3/8,2)`, giving the source's `y 0 / (1 - K * y 0)` bound;
* `mul_sqrt_mul_sqrt_le_young`, `absorb_sqrt_self_bound`,
  `self_bound_le_closed` — the Young-inequality absorption turning `M ≤ J + c
  √E √M + r M` (with `r` small) into a closed bound, which is the arithmetic
  content of the display of ABK26.

/-! ## The discrete Riccati step

At the self-referential gauge `(s,q) = (3/8,2)` the per-step ratio itself
involves the current value, so the compounding above is not directly available.
The source integrates the resulting Riccati inequality; the discrete analogue
below is exact and needs no differentiability. -/
