# The self-referential bootstrap along the perturbation path

Source: ABK26.  At the gauge exponents `(s,q) = (3/8, 2)` the per-cube
sensitivity estimate is *self-referential*: the growth rate of the coarse gauge
along the path `a + t h` is proportional to the coarse gauge itself.  The
source integrates the resulting Riccati inequality; that step presupposes
differentiability of an infinite weighted aggregate of finite maxima and is
therefore replaced here.

This module contains the gauge-free arithmetic of the replacement.  The input
is an abstract *ratio engine*

```
(∀ tau ∈ [t₁, t₂], Psi tau ≤ C)  ⟹  Psi t₂ ≤ exp (K C (t₂ - t₁)) * Psi t₁ ,
```

which is what a Grönwall estimate for the single-cube responses plus the
descendant aggregation produces, together with a *crude* uniform bound on `Psi`
over `[0,1]`.  Neither continuity nor differentiability of `Psi` is assumed.

The engine is run on a grid of mesh `T/N` with `N` chosen so large that the
crude bound only costs a factor `2` on one mesh interval.  On such an interval
the engine can be re-run with the *sharp* local bound `2 Psi (t_k)`, which turns
the exponential into the discrete Riccati step
`Psi (t_{k+1}) ≤ (1 + (4 K T / N) Psi (t_k)) Psi (t_k)` handled by
`Multiscale.riccati_step_le`.  The crude bound therefore never enters the
conclusion.

Every declaration is an internal helper for the Section 2.4 sensitivity
providers.

/-- **The self-referential bootstrap.**

Let `Psi ≥ 0` satisfy the ratio engine `hengine` and admit *some* finite bound
`B` on `[0,1]`.  If the initial value satisfies the smallness gate
`4 K Psi 0 < 1`, then `Psi` obeys the Riccati bound
`Psi T ≤ Psi 0 / (1 - 4 K Psi 0)` on all of `[0,1]`, with a constant that does
not involve `B`. -/
