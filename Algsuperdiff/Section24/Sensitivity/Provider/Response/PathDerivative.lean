# The response derivative along the whole perturbation path

The provider `Provider.Path.responseJ_derivative` differentiates the scalar
response `t ↦ J(U, a + t h, p, q)` only at the *base* point `t = 0`.  The `J`
sensitivity proof needs the derivative at *every* point of the segment `[0,1]`.
As in `Provider.Lambda.PathGronwall` (which does this for the pure-flux loading
`p = 0`), the path semigroup `(a + t h) + s h = a + (t + s) h` transports the
base-point statement to an arbitrary base point; the present module records the
general `(p, q)` version.

The second declaration is the elementary "mean-value" step used to integrate
the resulting differential inequality: a uniform bound on the derivative over
`[0,1]` bounds the increment.

Every declaration is an internal helper for the Section 2.4 sensitivity
providers.

/-! ## Differentiability at every point of the path -/

/-- **The scalar response is differentiable at every point of the perturbation
path**, with derivative one half of the `D_h` quadratic form at the current base
point tested against `(p, -q)`.

This is the derivative theorem `Provider.Path.responseJ_derivative` transported
along the path semigroup, exactly as in
`Provider.Lambda.PathGronwall.hasDerivAt_responseJ_perturbCoeffOn`, but for a
general loading `(p, q)` rather than the pure-flux loading `p = 0`. -/

/-! ## Integrating a uniform derivative bound -/

/-- **The increment of a differentiable function is controlled by a uniform
bound on its derivative.**  This is the elementary integration step behind the
source's passage from the pointwise derivative bound to the self-referential
inequality for the maximum of `J` along the segment. -/
