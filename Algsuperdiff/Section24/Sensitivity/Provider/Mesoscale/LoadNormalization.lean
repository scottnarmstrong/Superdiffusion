# Load normalization for the unconditional response estimate

The unconditional response estimate is proved at the loading `((mu
sigma0)^{-1/2} e, (mu sigma0)^{1/2} e)`.  The source first removes the `mu`-part
of the loading with `e.shaking.lambda`

applied with `lam = mu`, `p = sigma0^{-1/2} e` and `q = sigma0^{1/2} e`, and then
applies the conditional response estimate cube-by-cube at the mesoscopic scale.

This module contains the *load-normalization algebra* of that step, together
with the mesoscale factor bookkeeping of the four frozen terms of
`responseJ_sensitivity_unconditional`.  Everything here is proved.

## What is here

* `le_of_shaking_lambda_bound` — the gauge-free arithmetic that turns the
  square on the right of `e.shaking.lambda` into the two frozen terms
  `2 mu^{-1} J` and `mu^{-1} (mu - 1)^2 V`.

## Consumption points (deliberately NOT proved here)

1. **`e.shaking.lambda`.**  There is no Lean declaration for it in
   CoarseGraining or in this repository (only the exact scaling identity
   `responseJ_homogeneous`).  `le_of_shaking_lambda_bound` is written so that
   the shaking-lambda inequality enters as a hypothesis of the *caller*, not of
   any statement of this module.
2. **The conditional response estimate at mesoscopic cubes** (frozen theorem
   `responseJ_sensitivity` at `delta = 1`), stated on descendant cubes.

Every declaration in this module is an internal helper for the Section 2.4
sensitivity providers.

/-! ## The `mu`-normalization arithmetic -/

/-- **The `mu`-normalization arithmetic of `e.shaking.lambda`.**  Any quantity
bounded by the right-hand side of the shaking-lambda inequality at `lam = mu` is
bounded by the two frozen terms `2 mu^{-1} J` and `mu^{-1} (mu - 1)^2 V`.

The shaking-lambda inequality itself is a consumption point: it enters as the
hypothesis `hK` supplied by the caller. -/
