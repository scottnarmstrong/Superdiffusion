# Canonical laws and transformations of shell sequences

The manuscript's probability space is the canonical sequence carrier
`ℤ → ShellField d`.  This file provides its coordinate marginal laws and the
literal componentwise transformations used by J1 and J3.  It introduces no
probabilistic assumptions.

## Main definitions

* `shellMarginalLaw`: the law of one specified shell coordinate.
* `zeroShellLaw`: the law of shell zero.
* `translateSequence`: simultaneous real translation of every shell.
* `negateSequence`: simultaneous negation of every shell.
* `rotateSequence`: simultaneous signed-permutation conjugation of every shell.
