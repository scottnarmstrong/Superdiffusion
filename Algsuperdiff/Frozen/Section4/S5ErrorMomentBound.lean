# Moments of the localized error — [ABK] Section 5.1 (`e.error.rv.Sfive.moment.bound`)

Source: `references/algsuperdiff.tex:12854-12860`.

For a disorder model of strength `gamma` small enough there is a constant `C`
such that, at every scale `n` and every centre `y`, the localized error
`localizedError M n y` of the cube `y + □_n` has, for every exponent
`p ∈ [1, C⁻¹ gamma⁻¹ |log gamma|⁻¹]`, the moment bound

`𝔼[E^p]^{1/p} ≤ C (√p + √|log gamma|) √gamma |log gamma|³`.

The localized error is the normalized `L^∞` distance between the rough-field
Dirichlet solution on the cube and the solution of the comparator problem with
coefficient `σ̄_n I`, taken as a supremum over the normalized forcing class.

## Reading of the statement

* **`p`-th-power form.** The bound is stated as
  `∫⁻ E^p ≤ (ENNReal.ofReal amplitude)^p` rather than through the `p`-th root of
  the integral: the two are equivalent, and the power form is the one an
  `ℝ≥0∞`-valued integral states without a division.
* **One constant.** A single `C` serves both the amplitude and the upper end of
  the range of `p`, exactly as printed. It may depend on the dimension `d` and
  on the value `cstar` of the model's ellipticity parameter `c⋆`, that is
  `C = C(d, c⋆)`; no constant of Section 5 enters.
* **Small-disorder premise.** The hypothesis `M.gamma ≤ gamma0` is the standing
  regime `gamma ≤ gamma0(d, c⋆)` in which the estimates of Sections 3 and 4 are
  stated (`references/algsuperdiff.tex:372`), made explicit here so that the
  type shows it.
* **Cubes.** Cubes are indexed by `ℤ` and centred at an arbitrary `y`, the form
  in which Section 5.1 uses the estimate; the display of Section 4 is the case
  of a cube centred at the origin, and the two are related by translation
  covariance of the model.

## Conventions

* The amplitude carries the factor `√p + √|log gamma|`, as in the paper. It is
  the factor the generator renormalization theorem of Section 4 supplies for the
  same error amplitude, and it is what the percolation estimate of Section 5.2
  consumes.
* The absolute value is required at the odd power: `log gamma < 0` over the
  whole admissible range, so an unsigned cube would make the amplitude negative
  and the bound vacuously false.

Proved; reduces to the standard axioms.
