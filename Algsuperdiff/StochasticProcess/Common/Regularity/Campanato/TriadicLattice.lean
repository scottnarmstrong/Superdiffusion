# The triadic lattice of centres, and rounding toward the origin

An oscillation estimate produced by a scale-by-scale iteration is available
only at *lattice* centres: at each triadic scale the estimate is proved for the
cubes centred at the points of a lattice of that spacing.  A Hölder seminorm,
by contrast, is a statement about **every** pair of points.  Moving from the
one to the other requires replacing an arbitrary centre `x` by a nearby lattice
point `z`, and the whole cost of that replacement is governed by how far `z`
can be from `x`.

This file supplies the lattice and the rounding map.  Two properties of the
rounding are used downstream and both are sharp:

* the displacement is **strictly** below the lattice spacing, which is what
  allows the enclosing lattice cube to be exactly one triadic scale up; and
* rounding is done **toward the centre of the cube**, so `|z - c| ≤ |x - c|`
  coordinatewise and the rounded centre never leaves a cube centred at `c` that
  contains `x`.

The second property is what makes the lattice family applicable at the rounded
centre: the estimate is available only at lattice points **of the cube**, and
rounding to the *nearest* lattice point can leave it.

In the ambient space `Vec d = Fin d → ℝ` the norm is the supremum norm, so a
coordinatewise bound on the displacement is a bound on `‖x - z‖`.

## Main definitions

* `triadicLattice s` — the set of points of `Vec d` all of whose coordinates
  are integer multiples of the spacing `s`.
* `triadicGridPoint s x` — the coordinatewise rounding of `x` toward the
  origin at spacing `s`.
* `triadicLatticeAt c s`, `triadicGridPointAt c s x` — the same objects for a
  lattice through an arbitrary base point `c`, with the rounding done toward
  `c`.

## Main results

* `triadicGridPoint_mem_triadicLattice` — the rounded point is a lattice point.
* `norm_sub_triadicGridPoint_lt` — the displacement is below the spacing.
* `norm_triadicGridPoint_le` — rounding toward the origin does not increase the
  norm.
* `norm_sub_triadicGridPointAt_lt`, `triadicGridPointAt_mem_ball` — the same two
  statements for a cube centred at `c`.
