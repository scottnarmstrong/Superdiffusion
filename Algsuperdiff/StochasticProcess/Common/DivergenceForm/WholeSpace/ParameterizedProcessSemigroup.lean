# The retraction of the one-point compactification onto the live space

A process on the one-point compactification `OnePoint X` is read back on `X` through a
retraction that sends the added point to a chosen base point and is the identity on the live
part.  This module supplies that map and its measurability, which is what a quenched
observable on the live space needs before it can be integrated against the law of the
compactified process.

Measurability is not automatic: the retraction is not continuous at the added point.  It is
obtained instead from the two facts that the coercion `X → OnePoint X` is an open measurable
embedding and that the added point is a closed, hence measurable, singleton.
