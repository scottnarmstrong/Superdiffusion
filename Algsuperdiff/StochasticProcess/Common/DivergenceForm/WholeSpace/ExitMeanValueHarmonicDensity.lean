# Differences of harmonic parts and the density of the data

The harmonic parts of `ExitMeanValueHarmonicPart.lean` are attached to nonnegative continuous
data vanishing at infinity, because the exit decomposition is an extended-real statement.  A
general datum is a difference of two nonnegative ones, so this file records what differences
give.

One generic process fact comes first: the exit mean-value property is preserved by subtraction
of bounded measurable functions (`hasExitMeanValueOn_sub`).

The analytic input is the density of the resolvent range.  A positive `C₀`-contractive resolvent
has dense range at every shift, and a continuous datum vanishing at infinity is the difference of
its positive and negative parts, both nonnegative and vanishing at infinity.  Hence every
continuous datum vanishing at infinity is uniformly approximated by differences
`R_mu g₁ - R_mu g₂` of resolvents of nonnegative such data
(`exists_nonneg_c0_resolvent_approx`).

The two together are what a consumer instantiates: a bounded measurable function uniformly
approximated by differences of harmonic parts inherits their exit mean-value property.
