# The expected exit time from an exhaustion cube

The expected time the whole-space process spends in a bounded domain before
leaving it is the value at the starting point of the Dirichlet problem with
constant forcing on that domain.  This file proves that identity for the
exhaustion cubes.

The two inputs are already available.  The identification of the killed
resolvent with the Dirichlet resolvent of the part domain holds at every
positive shift and is carried here with its own hypotheses; instantiated at
the constant datum it is exactly the identification binder of the
expected-exit-time theorem, once the observable is replaced by the constant
one, which is legitimate because the killed kernels put no mass outside the
part domain (`killedResolvent_congr_of_eqOn`).  The limit binder is supplied
by the analytic layer: the Dirichlet resolvents of the constant datum increase
as the shift decreases, and their supremum along the shifts `1 / (n + 1)` is
`cubeExitFunction`.

Two one-sided forms follow, an upper bound from a uniform upper bound for the
limit on the cube and a lower bound on a subset from a uniform lower bound
there; the second is also recorded in the concrete form in which a single
positive shift already bounds the expected exit time from below.

The statements are about the process on the one-point compactification and the
exit time from the image of the cube there.  Reading them on ordinary
trajectories of the live space is a separate step and is not taken here.
