# Resolvent tails from a frozen pointwise estimate

The Agmon energy estimate only uses uniform ellipticity.  This module freezes
the coefficient at the point where the final interior estimate is read.  Thus
the coefficient may have a continuous skew part of arbitrary size: small
contrast is required only for the normalized frozen coefficient on the inner
ball.

/-! ### The two-scale tail function -/

/-- The explicit two-scale tail function.  Its arguments are
`s = sqrt mu * r` and `s₀ = sqrt mu * r₀`, where `r` is the source-free
radius and `r₀` is the radius on which the normalized frozen coefficient has
small contrast. -/
