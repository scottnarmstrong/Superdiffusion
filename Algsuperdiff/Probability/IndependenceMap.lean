# Independence under a pushforward measure

This file relates independence of two sigma-fields pulled back along a map to
independence of the original sigma-fields under the pushforward measure.

## Main results

* `indep_comap_iff_indep_map`: independence of two comap sigma-fields is
  equivalent to independence under the pushforward measure.

/-- Two sigma-fields pulled back along an almost-everywhere measurable map are
independent exactly when the original sigma-fields are independent under the
pushforward measure. The sigma-fields on the target must be contained in its
ambient measurable space so that the pushforward can be evaluated on all of
their events. -/
