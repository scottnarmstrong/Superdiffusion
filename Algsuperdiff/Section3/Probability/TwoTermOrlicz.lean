# Two-term weak-Orlicz bounds

This module formalizes the one-sided two-term weak-Orlicz notation of the
ABK26 Appendix. It records the source admissibility conditions on tail
functions, measurable witness random variables, and a pointwise
decomposition, without replacing the paper's one-sided tails by symmetric
ones.

## Main definitions

* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Probability.IsTwoTermBigOWithWitnesses`: a fixed
  measurable witness pair for a two-term weak-Orlicz bound.
* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Probability.IsTwoTermBigOWith`: the assertion
  `X ≤ O_{Ψ₁}(A₁) + O_{Ψ₂}(A₂)`.
* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Probability.IsAdmissibleTail`: the Appendix
  conditions on a tail function.

/-- A fixed witness pair for the one-sided two-term weak-Orlicz relation.

The tail functions are Appendix-admissible, the scales are positive, all three
random variables are measurable, `X` is pointwise bounded above by `Y + Z`,
and the two witnesses satisfy their respective one-sided weak-Orlicz tails. -/

`IsTwoTermBigOWith μ Ψ₁ Ψ₂ X A₁ A₂` means that the positive scales `A₁` and
`A₂` control measurable witnesses `Y` and `Z`, respectively, and that `X` is
pointwise bounded above by their sum. Each witness has the source's one-sided
weak-Orlicz tail, implemented by `IndependentSums.IsBigOWith`. -/
