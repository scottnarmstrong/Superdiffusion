# Dimension-only parameters for the cutoff `(P4)` route

The quantitative coarse-grained ellipticity input in CoarseGraining separates
its dimension-only exponent inequalities from its two genuine coefficient-law
moment obligations.  This file fixes the former once and for all for the actual
Section 3 cutoff route.  It deliberately does **not** assert those moments:
they must be proved for `coefficientCutoffLaw` from the cutoff's local
controls.

The choice is
`sUpper = sLower = 1/4` and `xi = 8*d + 1`.  It works for every manuscript
dimension `d >= 2`, and introduces no analytic assumption.
