# Transfer of lower-stream independence to the genuine cutoff carrier

The cutoff carrier is a full-measure subtype.  This module transfers completed
lower-stream independence to it using Borel local representatives, so no
unjustified claim that a completion is contained in the ambient Borel sigma
field is needed.
