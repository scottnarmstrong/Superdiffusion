# Integral-local measurability of the genuine lower cutoff

This module promotes finite lower-cutoff locality to the genuine lower-infinite
cutoff.  The target is the manuscript/CoarseGraining integral-local sigma-field
`LocalSigmaR U`: compactly supported entry tests in `U` are limits of the
corresponding finite lower-cutoff tests.  The limit is taken on the public
`CutoffSample` carrier, where lower-tail convergence is genuine, while the
domain sigma-field is the explicit lower-shell completion.

This proves local *observability*.  Spatial independence and its exact range
remain separate consequences, and are not asserted here.
