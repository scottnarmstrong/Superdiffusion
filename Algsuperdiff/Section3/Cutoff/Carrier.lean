# The public lower-tail sample carrier

The genuine lower-infinite cutoff is defined only on the full-measure carrier
where every required lower shell tail converges.  This module supplies that
carrier and its canonical induced probability law; it deliberately does not
define a cutoff value.

## Main definitions

* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Cutoff.CutoffSample`: the exact lower-tail-good
  subtype of the canonical shell-sequence carrier.
* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Cutoff.cutoffSampleLaw`: the canonical shell law
  induced on that subtype.
