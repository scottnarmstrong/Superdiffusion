# The Section 3 cutoff response observable

This module defines the source-facing Section 3.5 response observable using
the genuine running diffusivity `sigmaBar` at the coefficient-cutoff scale.
It evaluates the single measurable representative of the entire coarse block,
so every direction shares one probability-one event.

The final common-event theorem identifies this measurable observable with the
literal manuscript expression
`J(square_m, sigmaBar_L^(-1/2)e, sigmaBar_L^(1/2)e; a_L)` simultaneously for
every direction `e`.  No direction-dependent measurable modification and no
fallback comparator enters the definition.

/-- At each fixed cube scale, one probability-one event identifies the entire
integer-indexed family of source-facing responses with the literal manuscript
family, simultaneously for every coefficient-cutoff scale `L` and every
direction `e`.  Countability is used only for the intersection over `L`; the
uncountable direction quantifier was already placed inside each fixed-`L`
event by the common full-block representative. -/
