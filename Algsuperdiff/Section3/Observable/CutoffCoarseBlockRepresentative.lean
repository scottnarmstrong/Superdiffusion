# Canonical measurable coarse-block representatives for cutoff coefficients

The literal Chapter-2 homogenization error contains a maximum over all doubled
unit directions.  Consequently its measurable realization must start with one
common representative of the *entire* finite coarse block matrix on each cube,
not with independently chosen representatives for individual directions.

This file supplies that common representative.  It is `A.mk` of
CoarseGraining's a.e.-measurable coarse full-block observable and comes with
the explicit almost-everywhere identification to the raw coarse matrix.  The
final homogenization-error representative will be its finite-dimensional
continuous functional once that functional's equality with CoarseGraining's
literal sphere maximum has been proved.
