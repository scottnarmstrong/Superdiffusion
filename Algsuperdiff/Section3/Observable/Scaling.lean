# Section 3 cube normalization

This file supplies the literal triadic change of variables used to feed a
coefficient restriction on the centered cube `square_m` into the already
frozen unit-cube observables.  The normalized coefficient is the pullback

`x ↦ a (3^m x)`

on `square_0`.  It is constructed by CoarseGraining's public `CoeffOn.dilate`;
hence its ellipticity constants are the same as those of the source restriction
and its representative agrees almost everywhere with the displayed pullback.
