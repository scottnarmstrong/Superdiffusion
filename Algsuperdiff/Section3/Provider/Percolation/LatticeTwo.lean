# Distance-two lattice paths: geometry and separated selection

ABK26's abstract percolation machinery (`l.percolation.bound.general`) steps
along paths whose consecutive sites are at lattice distance at most one.  The
bad-cluster lemma `l.percolation.bad.clusters` however joins base cubes `□, □'`
with `dist(□,□') ≤ 1`, i.e. **lattice sup distance at most two** in units of
the cube side `3^{m-h}`.  A 2-adjacent chain is *not* a 1-adjacent lattice
path, so the abstract layer as proved does not literally cover 2-clusters.

This module is the first half of that re-run: the purely combinatorial geometry
of distance-two paths.  It is a parallel layer under new names; no proved
declaration is modified.

## Where the step size enters

Exactly three places, and each costs only a dimension-only factor:

* **Truncation.**  A distance-two path truncated at its first exit from `z +
  □_n` is confined to `2 · latDist z (x i) ≤ 3 ^ n + 3` (the distance-one layer
  has `3 ^ n + 1`).
* **Shell selection.**  The distance to the starting site now jumps by up to
  two per step, so a first passage of the level `m * s` proves in `[m*s, m*s +
  1]` rather than exactly on `m * s`; consecutive selected sites are therefore
  `s - 1`-separated instead of `s`-separated.  Taking the step `s = 3 ^ (k+1) +
  5` restores the separation `3 ^ (k+1) + 4` needed below.
* **Range of independence.**  The wider localisation boxes need the wider site
  separation `3 ^ (k+1) + 4` (against `3 ^ (k+1) + 2`) to keep the boxes at sup
  distance more than `3 ^ k`; `three_pow_lt_latDist_of_mem_locBox₂` supplies it.

The number `3 ^ (h - 3)` of selected sites — the quantity that drives the whole
induction — is **unchanged**, because the arithmetic
`2 · 3 ^ (h-3) · (3 ^ (k+1) + 5) ≤ 3 ^ (k+h)` still holds.  This is why the
gate constant of the distance-two layer is the same `16 d exp(40 (1-b)^{-1})` as
the distance-one one.

## Main definitions

* `IsLatticePath₂`: the distance-two path predicate.
* `locBox₂`: the localisation box of a truncated distance-two path.

## Main results

* `exists_truncated_path₂`: truncation at the first exit from a cube.
* `card_locBox₂_le`: `#(locBox₂ n z) ≤ 3 ^ (d * (n + 2))`.
* `three_pow_lt_latDist_of_mem_locBox₂`: the independence range.
* `exists_separated_subpaths₂`: the separated-subpath extraction, with the same
  count `3 ^ (h - 3)` as the distance-one layer.
