# Tuple bookkeeping for the scale-iteration inequality

ABK26's inequality `e.paths.ready.for.iteration` reads

`P[𝒞_{k+h}(z)] ≤ (W · sup_z P[𝒞_k(z)]) ^ M  +  W · h · sup {P[B_l(z)] : k < l ≤ k+h}`,

where `M = 3 ^ (h - 3)` is the number of well-separated sites extracted from a
long path (ABK26 uses `3 ^ (h - 4)`; the shell selection of
`SeparatedSelection.lean` gives the slightly better `3 ^ (h - 3)`) and
`W = 3 ^ (d (k + h + 1))` bounds the number of lattice sites the truncated path
can visit (ABK26 uses `3 ^ (d (k+h))` for the open cube; the truncated path can
also touch the sites just outside it, whence the extra factor `3 ^ d`).

The extraction step behind that inequality produces its well-separated sites as
a tuple indexed by `Fin M`, whereas the cluster and bad-event families are
indexed by `ℕ`.  This module supplies the piece of bookkeeping that reconciles
the two indexings.

## Main definitions

* `tupleFun`: the extension of a tuple of sites indexed by `Fin M` to a family
  indexed by `ℕ`, taking the value `0` beyond `M`.

## Main results

* `tupleFun_apply`: the extension agrees with the tuple at every index below
  `M`.
