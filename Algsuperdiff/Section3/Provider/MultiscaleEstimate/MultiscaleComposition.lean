# Provider: the composition of the two scale branches of `p.multiscale.estimate`

## What is delivered, and what is NOT

`multiscale_estimate_composed` is the frozen root's statement body
(`Frozen/Section3/MultiscaleEstimate.lean`, the block between) **verbatim,
binder for binder and amplitude spelling for amplitude spelling, with NO
premise inserted** and nothing else changed: the same `exists Cms`, the same
five source binders (`M`, `m`, `E`, the induction state, `epsilon`), the same
window `cstar^{-1} eps^{-Cms} <= E`, the same smallness `cgamma <=
(E^{-1})^{10}`, the same `s in [8 cgamma, 1]`, ONE `(Y, Z)` pair serving the
main conjunct AND the refinement clause, and the two amplitudes

```text
    Cms E s^{-1} sqrt(eps cgamma)   and   Cms eps (s^{-1})^2 exp(-E^{-3} cgamma^{-1}) .
```

Until that licensed edit happens, `p.multiscale.estimate` is not a closed
source node, and no docstring here may say otherwise.

## The two inputs (consumed, never re-derived)

Both are proved publics of this namespace, each proving the frozen body on one
side of the landmark `mStarStar M`:

* `multiscale_estimate_of_mStarStar` --- the frozen body with the single
  premise `mStarStar M < m`;
* `multiscale_estimate_of_le_mStarStar` --- the frozen body with the single
  premise `m <= mStarStar M`.

## The composition is not a plain `max`

The obvious composition --- take `Cms := max Cms_1 Cms_2` and transfer every
hypothesis by monotonicity --- **does not typecheck**, because one hypothesis of
the frozen body points the wrong way.  The frozen conclusion's second conjunct
is an *implication*

```text
    s <= Cms eps  ->  IsBigOWith mu Gamma_2 Y (Cms eps E s^{-1} sqrt cgamma) ,
```

so the composed `Cms` occurs there in *negative* position: enlarging `Cms` W
the guard we are handed and therefore weakens what the branch clause can be
fed.  The monotone transfer of the composed guard `s <= Cms eps` to the branch
guard `s <= Cms_i eps` needs `Cms <= Cms_i`, while the window hypothesis
`cstar^{-1} eps^{-Cms} <= E` and all three amplitudes need `Cms_i <= Cms`; the
two are compatible only at `Cms = Cms_1 = Cms_2`.  (That the branches' own
proofs never consume their guards is irrelevant here: this module consumes
their *statements*, in which the guard is an antecedent.)

Nor do the two routes below rescue the constant `max Cms_1 Cms_2` itself.  At
`Cms = max Cms_1 Cms_2`, take the branch whose constant `a` satisfies `Cms / 2 <
a < Cms`, and the regime `a / 2 < s <= Cms eps`.  Feeding the branch at an
enlarged parameter `eps'` (leaf 3) would need `s <= a eps'` with `eps' <= 1/2`,
i.e. `s <= a / 2`, which that regime denies; and reading the refinement off the
main amplitude (leaf 2) would need `a <= Cms sqrt eps`, i.e.  `eps >= (a /
Cms)^2`, while the regime gives only `eps > a / (2 Cms)`, which is smaller than
`(a / Cms)^2` exactly when `Cms < 2 a`.  Those two are the only sources of a
`Gamma_2` tail for `Y` that the branch statements expose, so the composed
constant must exceed `2 a`.

The branch window in fact admits any `eps' >= eps^{Cms/a}` (the window
transfers whenever `(eps')^{-a} <= eps^{-Cms}`), and shrinking `eps'` makes the
leaf-2 comparison easier.  So the conclusion stands on the full route family.
It is in any case immaterial to the theorem: the frozen statement is
existential in `Cms`.

The route taken instead --- which weakens nothing, the frozen statement being
existential in `Cms` --- is the constant

```text
    Cms := 2 * max Cms_1 Cms_2
```

together with a three-leaf case analysis, run inside `display_of_branch` for
whichever branch the scale `m` selects.  Write `a` for that branch's constant, so
`2 a <= Cms`.  Given the model datum and the frozen window at `Cms`:

1. **No guard** (`Cms eps < s`).  Apply the branch at `eps` itself; the main
   conjunct transfers by amplitude monotonicity (`a <= Cms`), and the refinement
   clause is vacuous.
2. **Guard, and `a < 2 s`.**  Apply the branch at `eps`.  Here `s <= Cms eps`
   and `a < 2 s` force `a < 2 Cms eps`, whence `a^2 <= Cms^2 eps` (this is where
   `2 a <= Cms` is spent) and so `a sqrt eps <= Cms eps`.  The refinement is then
   read off the *main* conjunct's own `Y`-tail (the `IsBigOWith` at the first
   amplitude bundled in `IsTwoTermBigOWithWitnesses`), whose amplitude
   `a E s^{-1} sqrt(eps cgamma)` is at most the refinement target
   `Cms eps E s^{-1} sqrt cgamma` exactly by that inequality.  No branch guard is
   needed.
3. **Guard, and `2 s <= a`.**  Apply the branch at the *enlarged* parameter
   `eps' := max eps (s / a)`, which lies in `(0, 1/2]` precisely because
   `2 s <= a`.  Then `a eps' = max (a eps) s <= Cms eps` (using the guard), which
   drives all three amplitude comparisons, while `s <= a eps'` is the branch
   guard, available by `le_max_right`.  Enlarging `eps` is legitimate in the
   window because `eps |-> eps^{-a}` is antitone: `eps <= eps'` gives
   `(eps')^{-a} <= eps^{-a} <= eps^{-Cms}`.

Leaf 2 is the only place where the composed constant must exceed `max Cms_1
Cms_2`, and `2 x` is the cheapest factor that works: the argument needs
`(a / Cms)^2 <= a / (2 Cms)`, i.e. exactly `2 a <= Cms`.

`0 ≤ a ≤ c` and `0 ≤ y`: both sides are square roots of `a ^ 2 * x` and

/-- The window transfer.  For `0 < eps ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ a ≤ C` and `eps ≤ eps'` the
map `t ↦ eps ^ (-t)` is monotone increasing and `t ↦ t ^ (-a)` is antitone, so
the frozen window at the composed exponent `C` implies the branch window at the
branch exponent `a` and the enlarged parameter `eps'`. -/

/-! ## 2. The carrier-level transfer

The composition never rebuilds a witness pair: it keeps the branch's `(Y, Z)`
and enlarges the three amplitudes.  The refinement clause travels with it, and
may be fed either by the branch's own clause or by the first amplitude's
`Y`-tail, which `IsTwoTermBigOWithWitnesses` bundles. -/

/-- Enlargement of a two-term bound **together with its refinement clause**,
preserving the witnesses.

`h₃` is the disjunctive route for the refinement: under the composed guard `Q`,
either the branch guard `P` holds and the branch's refinement amplitude fits, or
the *main* amplitude `A₁` already fits.  The first amplitude's tail is the ninth
component of `Probability.IsTwoTermBigOWithWitnesses`. -/

One model datum at a time.  `hbranch` is exactly what either proved branch
delivers after its scale premise and the induction state have been supplied. -/

a branch constant `a` with `2 * a ≤ C`.

doubling `2 * a ≤ C`. -/

/-! ## 4. The composition -/

/-- **The frozen `p.multiscale.estimate` body, with no premise.**

This is `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.multiscale_estimate`'s statement body
(the block between in `Frozen/Section3/MultiscaleEstimate.lean`) verbatim ---
binder for binder and amplitude spelling for amplitude spelling --- under a
different declaration name.

The proof is the tautological case split `lt_or_ge (mStarStar M) m` feeding the
two proved branches, `multiscale_estimate_of_mStarStar` above the landmark and
`multiscale_estimate_of_le_mStarStar` at or below it, through
`display_of_branch` at the common constant `2 * max Cms₁ Cms₂`.  The doubling
is forced by the refinement clause's guard, which occurs negatively; see the
module header, "The composition is not a plain `max`". -/
