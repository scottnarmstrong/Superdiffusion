# Provider: the `l`-aggregation of the bad-event term (`e.local.bad.events.summed`)

This is a *provider endpoint only*.  It is not a source node, it creates and
modifies no frozen declaration, and it closes no source node, no instance of a
source node and no fraction of a source node.

## 1. The printed display, and what is delivered

```
    E^2_{s/4,infty,2}(cu_m ; a_m, shom_m)
      . max_{l in (-infinity,m] cap Z} 3^{-s(m-l)/2}
          ( avsum_{z in 3^l Zd cap cu_m} 1_{not Q(l,l-h,z)} )^{s/d}
  <=  O_{Gamma_1}( C cstar^{-1} s^{-2} eps^{-C} cgamma )
    + O_{Gamma_{2/7}}( exp( -C^{-1} E^{-2} cgamma^{-1} ) ) .
```

`exists_badEventSummed_bound` (§5) is that display, at the multiscale root's
own binder set, with

* the left factor the Section 3 observable
  `Observable.cutoffHomogenizationError M m <s/4,_>` squared — the carrier in
  which `exists_crude_bound` states `e.mathcalE.crude.bound`;
* the printed `max_{l <= m}` as `⨆ j : ℕ` under the reindexing `j = m - l`, its
  weight written `3^{-(s/4).2.j}`, which is the *proved* spelling of `3^{-s
  j/2}` used by `BadEventMaxSplit` (the exponent slot of `Ch02.geometricWeight
  (s/4) 2`'s seam);
* the printed exponent `rho = s/d` (the printed `s/2d` is refuted there),
  inherited from `exists_badEvent_indicatorAverage_rpow_at_s_div_d`;

§6 then composes it with the proved max-first extraction and with the carrier
bridge, delivering the same estimate for the *post-step-1 middle expression* of
the printed derivation, in the almost-sure form admits.

## 2. The mechanism, in four lines

Write `W(omega)` for the printed maximum and `E^2(omega)` for the observable.

1. `W` is `[0,1]`-valued (`ciSup_three_rpow_mul_mem_Icc`): every weight is `<=
   1`, every averaged indicator is `<= 1`, every `rho`-power of a number in
   `[0,1]` is `<= 1`.
2. `W <= sum_j 3^{-s j/2}(avsum_z 1_{not Q})^{s/d}`
   (`ciSup_three_rpow_mul_le_tsum`) and the sum is
   `O_{Gamma_1}(gammaTriangleConst 1 . c_{s/2}^{-1} . A_bad)`
   (`isBigOWith_gammaOne_ciSup_three_rpow_mul`) — this is *the printed proof's
   own last step*, "summing over `l` instead of maxing".
3. `E^2 <= b + O_{Gamma_1}(A_1) + O_{Gamma_{2/7}}(A_2)` (`exists_crude_bound`,
   the proved `e.mathcalE.crude.bound`).
4. Hence, with `Y', Z' >= 0` the clamped witnesses of 3,

```
      E^2 . W  <=  (b + Y' + Z') . W  =  b.W + Y'.W + Z'.W
               <=  (b.W + Y') + Z'                     (because W <= 1) .
```

Only the D part `b` ever meets the `l`-sum; the two tail lanes meet the MAX,
which costs nothing.  No Orlicz product `e.multGammasig` is taken anywhere:
that route is index-refuted (`Gamma_{2/7} x Gamma_1 -> Gamma_{2/9}`, and `2/9 <
1/4`).

**Precisely what "unchanged" means here.**  The `Gamma_{2/7}` amplitude is
carried through V (`A_2` in and `A_2` out).  The `Gamma_1` amplitude is `(1 +
log 2)^{1^{-1}} . (b.K + A_1)`: the lane is merged with `b.W` by the two-event
union bound of `Provider.Multiscale.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_add`
(`ConclusionSeam3Closure.lean`), at the cost of the pure constant `1 + log 2 =
1.693...`, with NO power of `s`, no `d` and no `cstar`.

## 3. Where the printed `s^{-2}` comes from

Two independent factors `s^{-1}`, and they multiply only the deterministic
shift:

* `c_{s/2}^{-1} <= 20 s^{-1}` from the `l`-sum's total mass
  (`inv_geometricDiscount_quarter_two_le`, the `(s/4, 2)` instance of the
  upstream `Ch02.inv_geometricDiscount_le_five_inv`).

The deterministic shift itself is a pure constant on the printed window: the
proved `lowerEllipticityProfile_exponentTwo_quarter_le` gives `b = 8 Ccg + 8.
3^{cgamma}. lowerEllipticityProfile Ccg cgamma (s/4) 2 <= 8 Ccg + 16 Ccg.
3^{cgamma} / 3 <= 24 Ccg` at `cgamma <= 1`.  It is NOT bounded inside the
delivered statement: the explicit expression is kept, which is strictly
stronger and is what the crude bound itself carries.

The crude bound's own `Gamma_1` amplitude
`8 (Ccg cstar^{-1} (s/4) cgamma (2(s/4) - cgamma)^{-3})` is carried verbatim;
on the printed window `8 cgamma <= s` it is `<= C cstar^{-1} cgamma s^{-2}`,
matching the print, and that bound is not re-proved here.

Finally `3^{5h} <= eps^{-C}` — the printed absorption at `h := C |log eps|` —
is the consumer's, not this file's; the delivered amplitude carries `3^{5h}`
explicitly.

## The scale gate on `m`

The landmark premise carried by both endpoints below is `mStarStar M < m`,
**not** the printed `m0 in (mstar, infty) cap Z` that it inherits through
`exists_crude_bound` from `l.shom.continuity`.  Nothing else moved: the premise
is forwarded verbatim to the producers consumed here, no proof step here
consumes it, and no frozen statement changes.

## 4. Hypotheses

The premises are the printed ones: `inductionState M (m-1) E` (the multiscale
root's own state, as `exists_crude_bound` and
`exists_badEvent_indicatorAverage_rpow_at_s_div_d` carry it); the landmark gate
`mStarStar M < m`, inherited verbatim from `exists_crude_bound` and forwarded,
never consumed here; the four `E`-gates and `cgamma <= (E^{-1})^{10}` of
`e.param.conditions.in.main`; the bad-event producer's own slice
`epsilon in Ioc 0 (1/2)`, `(h:ℝ) <= H |log epsilon| + 1`,
`cstar^{-1} epsilon^{-C} <= E`; and the printed window `8 cgamma <= s <= 1` of
`l.localization.mathcalE`.  The measurability hypotheses of the abstract
engines are discharged at the concrete carrier by
`measurable_badEventAverage_rpow` and `Measurable.iSup`.

Two binders are not literally printed: `1 <= h`, and the per-lane nonemptiness
of `F` (the printed grid `3^{m-j} Zd cap cu_m` contains `0`, so this is free at
the intended instantiation).

**On `1 <= h`.**  The printed window is `h in N_0 cap [0, cgamma^{-1}]`, which
admits `h = 0`; this file needs `h >= 1`, and the reason is structural, not
technical.  The lane `j = 0` of the maximum carries the bad event
`Q(m, m-h, z)`, whose producer needs the induction state at the coarse scale
`m - h <= m - 1`; at `h = 0` that is the state at scale `m`, i.e. the
multiscale root's own conclusion, which would be circular.  It costs the
consumer nothing: at the intended instantiation
`h := waveCutoff C0 eps = ceil(C0 |log eps|)`, the bound
`1 <= ceil(C0 |log eps|)` follows from `0 < C0` and `eps in Ioc 0 (1/2)` alone,
since `eps <= 1/2` forces `|log eps| >= log 2 > 0` and `Nat.one_le_ceil_iff`
then gives the ceiling `>= 1` (`one_le_waveCutoff`).  Nothing in this file
discharges the binder; it is stated rather than hidden.

## 5. What this file does NOT deliver

* **Step 1** of the printed derivation, the per-scale pre-ceiling
  `avsum_z max_e J^{d/s} 1_{not Q} <= (max_z max_e J)(avsum_z 1_{not Q})^{s/d}`,
  is `BadEventPreCeiling`'s.  The left side of §6's endpoints is the
  post-step-1 middle expression of the print verbatim — the same left side
  `BadEventMaxSplit` carries.
* **The grid instantiation** `F j := 3^{m-j} Zd cap cu_m`: `F` stays free; only
  per-lane nonemptiness is used, and no cardinality of `F` enters anywhere.
* **`3^{5h} <= eps^{-C}` and the window `cgamma h <= 1`.**
* **The single extraction of the bad-event constant.**  The good-event level
  delivered here is `2 . Cbad`, and `Cbad` is the first component of
  `exists_badEventSup_isBigOWith_gammaOne`, i.e. the `Ccg` of
  `Frozen.bad_event_estimate`.  It is a *different* constant from
  `exists_crude_bound`'s `Ccg` (`Frozen.coarse_ellipticity_bounds`), and the
  two are kept apart in every statement of this file:
  `exists_badEventSummed_bound` binds `Ccg` and `Cbad` separately and never
  conflates them.  There is nothing to match against the induction state:
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.inductionState` carries no good-event constant
  at all (it is two `sigmaBar` bracketings plus a `Gamma_2`/`Gamma_{1/2}`
  two-term display for `cutoffHomogenizationError`), and `goodLocalEventAt`
  occurs nowhere outside the four `MultiscaleEstimate` files.  The seam is
  therefore an assembly obligation, not a statement one: the assembly must
  extract the bad-event existential once and thread that same `Cbad` into the
  localization fourth term and into this endpoint.
* **Measurability of the raw `l`-sum.**  The per-scale response
  `Ch02.maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale` at the *raw* cutoff
  coefficient family is not known measurable here (only its representative is),
  so the §6 endpoints are stated as an almost-sure domination by a named
  measurable witness pair rather than as `Probability.IsTwoTermBigOWith` at
  that left side, whose carrier demands `Measurable X`.  §6's display, whose
  left side is the *observable* and hence measurable, carries the genuine
  `IsTwoTermBigOWith`.

/-- **The ceiling composition at a general `[0,1]`-valued factor**, with the
deterministic shift priced through the factor's own smallness.

```
    X <= b + O_{Gamma_{s1}}(A1) + O_{Gamma_{s2}}(A2) ,   0 <= V <= 1 ,
    V <= O_{Gamma_{s1}}(K)
  =>  X . V  <=  O_{Gamma_{s1}}( (1 + log 2)^{s1^{-1}} . (b K + A1) )
                 + O_{Gamma_{s2}}( A2 ) .
```

Three facts and no more: `V >= 0` moves the domination inside the product; `V
<= 1` lets the two clamped witnesses pass through unchanged (`Y'.V <= Y'`),
which is the mechanism and the reason no Orlicz product is taken; and the deterministic part
becomes `b.V`, which is `Gamma_{s1}` at `b K` — this is what removes the
constant term `b` from the right-hand side, turning the crude bound's `C +
Gamma_1 + Gamma_{2/7}` into the printed `Gamma_1 + Gamma_{2/7}` of
`e.local.bad.events.summed`.

The witnesses are named: the output pair is `(b.V + max 0 Y, max 0 Z)`, the
clamps being the free `Provider.Tail.isBigOWith_max_zero` (the two-term
witnesses are only known measurable and dominating, never nonnegative).

The merge of the two `Gamma_{s1}` lanes is
`Provider.Multiscale.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_add`
(`Multiscale/ConclusionSeam3Closure.lean`), the two-event union bound at `(1 +
log 2)^{s1^{-1}}`: it needs `0 < s1` and the two displays, and NOTHING else —
no nonnegativity, no measurability.  The `gammaTriangleConst s1` merges
(`Orlicz/TwoTermCalculus.lean`, `TailSqrt.lean`,
`CoarseEllipticity/BlockPayload.lean`) would cost `16384` here instead of
`1.693...`; see the module header's §7.

This is NOT `ceiling_product` (`BadEventIngredients.lean`), which is single-`l`
(one scalar weight, one `Finset`) and which keeps the deterministic shift `b`
rather than pricing `b.V`; see the module header's twin census. -/

variable {Ω : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω] {μ : Measure Ω}

/-- **The `l`-aggregation.**  If every lane obeys the SAME `Gamma_1` display at
amplitude `A` — which is what the printed averaged-indicator display gives,
since its amplitude does not depend on `l` — then the printed maximum obeys

```
    max_j 3^{-s j/2} G_j  <=  O_{Gamma_1}( gammaTriangleConst 1 . B ) ,
    B >= c_{s/2}^{-1} . A .
```

Route: weight each lane (`IsBigOWith.const_mul`), sum by the countable
`Gamma_1` triangle at nonnegative amplitudes
(`Provider.Orlicz.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_tsum_of_nonneg_amplitude_of_tsum_le`),
evaluate the amplitude series in closed form, then dominate the maximum by the
sum (`IsBigOWith.of_le`). -/

Every lane is the proved per-lane display
`exists_badEvent_indicatorAverage_rpow_at_s_div_d` read at `l := m - j`, whose
amplitude is independent of `l`; the aggregation engine of §3 then pays the `l`-sum
once, at the total mass `c_{s/2}^{-1} <= 20 s^{-1}`.

Binders beyond the two producers': `1 <= h` (module header §4 — the `j = 0`
lane's bad event needs the state one scale below `m`) and per-lane nonemptiness
of the free grid family `F`. -/

/-! ## 5. `e.local.bad.events.summed` -/

/-- **The revised `e.local.bad.events.summed`** (canonical revision), at the
multiscale root's own binder set:

```
    E^2_{s/4,infty,2}(cu_m; a_m, shom_m)
      . max_{l <= m} 3^{-s(m-l)/2}( avsum_{z in F} 1_{not Q(l,l-h,z)} )^{s/d}
  <=  O_{Gamma_1}( C(d) cstar^{-1} s^{-2} ( 3^{5h} cgamma
                                            + exp(-c E^{-2} cgamma^{-1}) ) )
    + O_{Gamma_{2/7}}( C exp( -Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} cgamma^{-1} ) ) ,
```

with both amplitudes written out in full rather than absorbed into a `C`.  The
left factor is the Section 3 observable, the maximum is the `⨆ j : ℕ` of the
reindexing `j = m - l`, and there is NO deterministic term on the right — that
is the whole point of §1's engine, and the reason the bad factor's own
`Gamma_1` smallness is needed.

The three ingredient displays enter exactly once each: `exists_crude_bound`
(display 1) as the two-term input, the per-lane averaged-indicator display
(display 3, at `rho = s/d`) through the `l`-aggregation, and the `[0,1]`
ceiling (`BadEventCeiling`) as the pointwise bound on the maximum.  Display 2
(`e.badevent.indicator.propagate`) is NOT on this path: the proved display 3 is
an independent consumer of the same per-site probability input.

Amplitude reading (module header §3): `8 Ccg + 8. 3^{cgamma}.
lowerEllipticityProfile.` is the crude bound's deterministic shift, a pure
constant `<= 24 Ccg` on the window; it is the ONLY factor that meets the
`l`-sum's `20 s^{-1}`.  The consumer still owes `3^{5h} <= eps^{-C}` at `h:=
ceil(C|log eps|)`. -/
