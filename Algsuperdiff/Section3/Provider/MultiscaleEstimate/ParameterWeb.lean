# Provider: the parameter web of `p.multiscale.estimate`

This module collects the *parameter-discharge* obligations that the Section 3.6
development accumulated across its proved packets and routes all of them
through a single arithmetic core: the two scalar binders of the multiscale
proposition's own hypothesis list,

```
(c⋆)⁻¹ ε^{-Cms} ≤ E                  (the window)
γ ≤ (E⁻¹)^{10}                       (the smallness)
```

## The arithmetic core, in one paragraph

On `ε ∈ (0,1/2]` one has `ε⁻¹ ≥ 2`, hence `ε^{-a} ≥ 2^a` for every `a ≥ 0`
(`two_rpow_le_rpow_neg`).  The proved `Provider.Disorder.cstar_le_three_halves`
gives `c⋆⁻¹ ≥ 2/3`, so the window binder yields the two floors

```
K * c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E        whenever K ≤ 2^{Cms}        (the RELATIVE gate)
K ≤ E               whenever (3/2) K ≤ 2^{Cms}  (the ABSOLUTE gate)
```

and in particular `10 ≤ E` as soon as `Cms ≥ 4`.  The smallness binder then
turns every `E`-floor into a `γ`-ceiling.  For the corridor one uses the
*logarithmic* form of the same window: `ε^{-Cms} = exp(Cms |log ε|)` and
`x + 1 ≤ exp x` give `Cms |log ε| ≤ (3/2) E`, so the integer cutoff
`h := waveCutoff (2 Chom) ε = ⌈2 Chom |log ε|⌉` obeys `h ≤ 3 Chom E / Cms + 1`,
which is `≤ 3E + 1` once the witness satisfies `Chom ≤ Cms`.

## The `10^9` and where it may appear (development decision D4)

What §3 and §5 prove is strictly stronger and numeral free — the `ε^2` form `γ
≤ Chom⁻¹ E^{-2} ε^2` (development decision D2, the form the proved
`homogenizationStep_spec` consumes) and the corridor `γ h ≤ 1`, both on a
**free** real `Chom` and on the sole witness constraints `4 ≤ Cms`, `Chom ≤
Cms`, `Chom ≤ 2^{Cms}`.

Those constraints are satisfiable for **every** real `Chom`: that is
`exists_parameterWeb_general` (§8), which binds `Chom` freely.  Consequently
`max (homogenizationStepConst d) 10^9` is a legitimate instantiation of that
theorem, at which this module's own `Chom`-free dischargers
(`gamma_mul_waveCutoff_le_one`, and `chom_le_pow_mul_sq_of_window` composed
with `gamma_le_gate_of_pow`) deliver BOTH enlarged obligations — the corridor
and the `ε^2` gate at the enlarged constant.  The numeral `10^9` therefore
occurs in no statement of this file: it is a *witness choice inside an
existential* and never a claim about `.choose`.

## `_root_` anchoring: prophylactic, measured

The three `open _root_.…` lines below are **not** load-bearing in this module.
The anchoring is kept because the enclosing namespace
`Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.MultiscaleEstimate` is a sibling of
`Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Multiscale` (Section 3.3, 77 files, live name
collisions — development decision D5), so a future sibling declaration named
`Homogenization` or `MeasureTheory` would silently capture the open.  No claim
of present load-bearing is made.

(ii) (vi).  Both are instances of one of two shapes, and both are absorbed by
the root's own `c⋆⁻¹ ε^{-Cms}` witness at a witness-choice constraint on `Cms`. -/

/-- **The relative gate.**  A demand of the shape `K c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` — the shape of
`p.homogenization.step`'s `15 c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` and of `l.shom.continuity`'s
`Cshom c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` — is discharged by the window as soon as the chosen witness
satisfies `K ≤ 2^{Cms}`.  No bound on `c⋆` is needed on this branch. -/

the model-free part of the argument — the shape of the coarse-graining gate
`exp(Ccg/(1/7)) ≤ E` — is discharged by the window together with `c⋆ ≤ 3/2`, at
the witness-choice constraint `(3/2) K ≤ 2^{Cms}`. -/

/-- ** (vi): `15 c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E`.**

The honest route is `2^{Cms} ≥ 15`, i.e. `Cms ≥ 4`: the demand is *relative* to
`c⋆⁻¹`, exactly like the root's own window, so it needs no bound on `c⋆`
whatsoever.  That route proves a *different* statement (`10 ≤ E`, delivered
separately as `ten_le_of_window`) and does not by itself give `15 c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E`
when `c⋆` is small; the `2^{Cms} ≥ 15` route does, uniformly in the model, and
is the one taken. -/

Every `E`-floor of §2 becomes a `γ`-ceiling through the root's own second
scalar binder `γ ≤ (E⁻¹)^{10}`. -/

/-- The arithmetic core of the `ε²` smallness gate: the window forces
`Chom ≤ E^8 ε^2` at the witness-choice constraints `4 ≤ Cms`,
`Chom ≤ 2^{Cms}`.

The margin is enormous and entirely explicit: `E^8 ε^2 ≥ (2/3)^8 2^{8Cms-2}`,
while the constraint only asks `Chom ≤ 2^{Cms}`, so the slack is the factor
`(2/3)^8 2^{7Cms-2} ≥ (256/6561)·2^{26} > 2.6·10^6` at `Cms = 4`. -/

(`abs_log_le_of_window`) bounds `|log ε|` by `(3/2) E / Cms`, the ceiling costs
one, and `Chom ≤ Cms` turns the result into `h ≤ 3E + 1`, which `γ ≤ E^{-10}`
crushes at `E ≥ 10` with nine orders of magnitude to spare.

The witness-choice constraint `Chom ≤ Cms` is the whole of what the corridor
costs; `exists_parameterWeb_general` meets it, at a `Chom`, hence also at the

The absorption at the integer cutoff, in the exact `rpow` spelling `(3: ℝ) ^ (5

(`BadEventIngredients.lean`, `BadEventSummed.lean`).  The output constant is

leaves the factor `3^5 = 243`, which `ε ≤ 1/2` absorbs into `ε^{-8}` because
`2^8 = 256 ≥ 243`.  The proved private twin at exponent `8`
(`three_pow_eight_cutoff_le` in `WaveSizesZeroth.lean`) leaves its `6561`

/-! ## 7. The almost-everywhere to pointwise witness bridge
((iii))

`Probability.IsTwoTermBigOWithWitnesses` demands the domination `∀ ω, X ω ≤ Y ω
+ Z ω` **pointwise**, while every Section 3 identification of an observable
with an analytic quantity is only almost everywhere (the observables are
measurable representatives).

The proved witness upgrade `Provider.Tail.isTwoTermBigOWith_of_ae_le`
(`Provider/Tail/TailSqrt.lean`) delivers the **existential**
`IsTwoTermBigOWith` and forgets the modified witnesses.  The frozen multiscale
conclusion is not of that shape: its second conjunct is an `IsBigOWith` clause
on the *same* `Y` that the first conjunct names, so the upgrade must return
witnesses whose relation to the given ones is known.  The statement below
returns exactly that — the modified pair is almost everywhere equal to the
given pair — from which every tail of the original witnesses transfers by the
proved `Provider.Tail.isBigOWith_of_ae_eq`.  In particular the refinement
clause survives the modification with no extra hypothesis.

The construction is the proved one (modify on the measurable null set where the
inequality fails, sending the failure into the `Z`-slot); the two tail
transfers `Provider.Tail.isBigOWith_of_ae_eq`.  `IsFiniteMeasure` is NOT
required. -/

/-! ## 8. Feasibility of the witness choice

Every constraint the web places on `Cms` is a constraint on the *existential
witness of the conclusion*, chosen after the homogenization constant `Chom` is
in hand (development decision D4).

`exists_parameterWeb_general` is the theorem with `Chom` a free binder, which
is what makes the enlarged witness `max Chom 10^9`'s addendum a genuine
instantiation rather than a wish. -/

/-- `2 ^ (log K / log 2) = K` for `K > 0`; the base-2 logarithm written out, so
that §8's witness needs no `Real.logb` in its statement.

The proof below therefore the Mathlib lemma rather than re-deriving it, and
this statement is retained only as the `log/log` spelling in which the witness
of `exists_parameterWeb_general` is written.  Any future base-2 site must
consume `Real.rpow_logb` directly. -/

    (2 : ℝ) ^ (Real.log K / Real.log 2) = K := by

  exact Real.rpow_logb (by norm_num) (by norm_num) hK

/-- **The parameter web is feasible, at every `Chom`.**  For every real
homogenization constant `Chom`, every window exponent `Cwin` that a consumer
carries in its own existential, and every pair of development constants `Ccg`,
`Cshom`, there is a witness `Cms` meeting *all* constraints the dischargers of
§2-§6 impose at once:

* `4 ≤ Cms` — the `E ≥ 10` floor, the `15 ≤ 2^{Cms}` gate and the `ε²` gate;
* `Chom ≤ Cms` — the corridor budget `γ h ≤ 1`
  (`gamma_mul_waveCutoff_le_one`);
* `Cwin ≤ Cms` — the transfer of the root's window, through `window_of_le`, to
  a consumer that carries its OWN existential window constant.
* `Chom ≤ 2^{Cms}` — the `ε²` smallness gate;
* `(3/2) exp(Ccg/(1/7)) ≤ 2^{Cms}` — the coarse-graining gate;
* `Cshom ≤ 2^{Cms}` — the `l.shom.continuity` gauge gate;
* `15 ≤ 2^{Cms}` — the `15 c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` of `p.homogenization.step` (
  `Frozen/Section3/HomogenizationStep.lean`).

The witness is explicit: the `max` of `4`, of `Chom`, of `Cwin`, of the
absorption exponent, and of the base-2 logarithm of the largest multiplicative
constant in play.  Only numerals already printed in the constraints occur. -/
