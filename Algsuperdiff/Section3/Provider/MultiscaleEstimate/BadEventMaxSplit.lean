# Provider: the max-first extraction of the bad-event fourth term

This is a *provider endpoint only*.  It is not a source node, it creates and
modifies no frozen declaration, and it closes no source node, no instance of a
source node and no fraction of a source node.

## 1. The order that works

The printed derivation reads as three steps: a per-scale ceiling, then the
single-term bound in the series defining `E^2_{s,infty,2}`, then a replacement
of the `l`-sum by its `l`-max.  Steps 2 and 3 each hide a factor `~ s^{-1}` and
they compound, so the literal reading yields one power of `s^{-1}` past the
printed `E^2_{s/4} max_l (.)` — and that power is not absorbable.

The admissible order, formalized here, extracts the `max` first and pays
the `l`-sum once, against the definition of `E^2_{s/4}`:

```
   sum_l c_{2s} 3^{-s(m-l)} (max_z max_e J_l) (avsum 1_{not Q})^{s/d}
 = (c_{2s}/c_{s/2}) sum_l [ c_{s/2} 3^{-s(m-l)/2} (max_z max_e J_l) ]
                        . [ 3^{-s(m-l)/2} (avsum 1_{not Q})^{s/d} ]
 <= (c_{2s}/c_{s/2}) . ( max_l 3^{-s(m-l)/2}(avsum 1_{not Q})^{s/d} ) . E^2_{s/4}
```

Two facts make this work, and both are verified here against the *proved*
carriers rather than assumed:

* **The seam.**  The bracketed left factor is the `j`-th summand of the series
  defining `E^2_{s/4,infty,2}(cu_m)`.  `geometricWeight_quarter_two_eq` records
  the identity `Ch02.geometricWeight (s/4) 2 j = c_{s/2}. 3^{-(s/4).2.j}` (as
  the `(s/4, 2)` specialization of the proved in-closure
  `ErrorComparison.geometricWeight_eq'`, `FiniteQTransfer.lean`, which is
  itself the definitional `rfl`), and the upstream
  `Ch02.homogenizationErrorOnCube_infinity_two_sq_eq_tsum` states
  `E_{s/4,infty,2}(Q)^2 = sum_j Ch02.geometricWeight (s/4) 2 j.
  maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale Q (Q.scale - j) a a0`, whose
  per-scale factor is the printed `max_z max_e J(z + cu_{m-j})`.  The index
  seam `s/4` versus `s/2` is therefore *sound as printed*: the series of `E^2`
  at the parameter `s/4` and `q = 2` carries the weight `c_{(s/4).2}
  3^{-(s/4).2.j} = c_{s/2} 3^{-s j/2}`.  No index is adjusted.
* **The constant is a pure `C(d)` — in fact `4`, and `4` is sharp.**  With
  `q := 3^{-s/2}` one has `3^{-2s} = q^4`, hence
  `c_{2s} = 1 - q^4 = (1-q)(1+q+q^2+q^3) <= 4(1-q) = 4 c_{s/2}` for every
  `s >= 0`, by pure factorization and with no transcendental input at all
  (`geometricDiscount_two_le_four_mul_quarter`).  The ratio
  `c_{2s}/c_{s/2}` increases to `4` as `s -> 0+` (numerically `3.967` at
  `s = 0.01`, `3.691` at `s = 0.1`, `2.103` at `s = 1`), so `4` is the least
  uniform constant on `(0,1]`.

The honest sharp constant is `4`, it is what is proved here, and it needs no
upper bound on `s` at all (only `0 <= s`).  Nothing is forced to `5.2`.

## 2. The `[0,1]` ceiling is what makes the extracted factor free

records that the revision's `max` is load-bearing: with the max, the extracted
second factor `max_l 3^{-s(m-l)/2}(avsum_z 1_{not Q})^{s/d}` is `[0,1]`-valued
(weight `<= 1`, average `<= 1`, power `<= 1`), so the cross terms of the crude
bound cost nothing; with the `l`-sum the same factor's ceiling is its total
weight mass `~ 36 s^{-1}` and the cross term gains an unabsorbable `s^{-1}`.

That ceiling is available at the exact development carrier by composing the
sibling `weightedIndicatorAverage_rpow_mem_Icc` (`BadEventCeiling.lean`) with
the weight `3^{-(s/4).2.j}`, which lies in `[0,1]` for `s >= 0`.

It is **not** what the downstream Orlicz composition `ceiling_product`
(`BadEventIngredients.lean`) consumes, and the earlier draft of this paragraph
said otherwise.  `ceiling_product` is *single-`l`* — one pair `(l, n)`, one
*scalar* weight `w`, no `j`-family and no `max_l` — and its seam is the pair
of scalar bounds `hw0 : 0 <= w`, `hw1 : w <= 1`; it re-derives the product
ceiling internally through `weightedIndicatorAverage_rpow_mem_Icc` and cannot
take a `mem_Icc` conclusion at all, whose shape is different.

## 3. What is delivered

*The abstract extraction engine*, over abstract reals, so that no
transcendental ever meets an arithmetic tactic:

* `tsum_weighted_square_mul_le` (countable, the reindexing `j = m - l`).

*The ratio*, at the honest sharp constant `4`:

* `geometricDiscount_two_le_four_mul_quarter`,
* `geometricDiscount_quarter_two_pos` (the single upstream wrapper kept, as the
  normal form the ratio's `div_le_iff₀` reads; the matching `c_{2s} >= 0` is
  consumed straight from `Ch02.book_geometricDiscount_nonneg` at its point of
  use and no wrapper for it is supplied),
* `geometricDiscount_two_div_quarter_le_four`.

*The `E^2`-series shape* and the extraction at the series weights:

* `geometricWeight_quarter_two_eq` (**the seam**),
* `three_rpow_quarter_two_mul_self`, `geometricWeight_quarter_two_nonneg`,
* `tsum_geometricDiscount_two_mul_le_four_mul`.

*The composed form*:

* `tsum_badMax_le_four_mul_homogenizationErrorOnCube_sq` — at the `E^2`
  carrier, with an abstract nonnegative second factor.

One `private` plumbing lemma (`three_rpow_mul_natCast_add`) absorbs the
`Real.rpow 3 x` / `(3 : ℝ) ^ x` spelling seam.

## 4. Hypotheses

The hypotheses are the display's own: `0 < s` (from the printed window
`8 cgamma <= s <= 1`; only positivity is used), the nonnegativity of the
printed factors, the positivity of the two geometric normalizations `c1`, `c2`,
and the domination `hW`, which says exactly that `W` — the printed `max_l` —
dominates the printed second factors.  `[NeZero d]` is carrier-forced:
`Ch02.HomogenizationErrorOnCube` and
`Ch02.maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale` carry it in their own
signatures.  The one remaining binder, `hsum : Summable ...`, is discussed next.

No `2 <= d` binder, no `NeZero d` binder beyond the two carriers that declare
it themselves, and no induction-state, `mStar`, `cstar` or `E` premise appears
anywhere in this file.

## 5. Where the summability obligation is genuine, and where it is not

**On the abstract engines the binder is genuine and load-bearing.** `Summable (fun
i => c1 . v i . f i)` is carried by `tsum_weighted_square_mul_le` and
`tsum_geometricDiscount_two_mul_le_four_mul` and cannot be dropped there:
Lean's `tsum` is `0` off summability, so the right side of the extraction
collapses while the left side does not.  The `hsum`-free abstract statement is
false: at `c1 = c2 = W = 1`, `v = f = 1`, `g i = (1/2)^i` its left side is `2`
and its right side is `0`.

**At the `E^2` carrier the binder is NOT a caller obligation, and is not
carried.**  The composed form
`tsum_badMax_le_four_mul_homogenizationErrorOnCube_sq` instantiates `f j` at
`Ch02.maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale (cu_m) (m - j) a a0`, and at
that instance the series is *unconditionally* summable from `0 < s` alone, by
the proved upstream

* `Ch02.summable_geometricWeight_two_mul_maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale`,
  at `Q := cu_m` (whose `.scale` is `m` by `rfl`) and at the parameter `s/4`,

which is inside this file's own three-import closure.  The composed form
discharges it inline, so nothing in the file is conditional at the concrete
carrier.

`Real.rpow 3 x` and `(3 : ℝ) ^ x` are `rfl`-equal but not syntactically equal,
and `rw` matches on the head symbol, so a `show` is required to move between
them.  Both lemmas below exist only to absorb that seam; they are `private`. -/

/-! ## 2. The abstract extraction engine

Everything here is about abstract reals: no transcendental function occurs, so
no arithmetic tactic ever meets one.  The shape is the mechanism display with
the two geometric normalizations named `c₁` (the series' own, `c_{s/2}`) and
`c₂` (the printed outer one, `c_{2s}`), and with `v i` the half-weight
`3^{-s(m-l)/2}`:

```
    sum_i c₂ (v i)^2 (f i . g i)
      = (c₂/c₁) sum_i (c₁ . v i . f i) . (v i . g i)
      <= (c₂/c₁) . W . sum_i c₁ . v i . f i ,     W >= v i . g i for all i.
```

The `W`-slot *is* the printed `max_l`. -/

/-- **The extraction engine, countable index set.**  The same statement for
`tsum`s over `ℕ`, which is the reindexing `j = m - l` of the manuscript's
`l`-sum over `(-infinity, m] cap ℤ`.

`hsum` is a caller obligation at this abstract level and is load-bearing here
(see §5 of the module docstring): it is what makes the right-hand series a genuine sum
rather than Lean's `0` default, and without it the statement is false — at `c₁
= c₂ = W = 1`, `v = f ≡ 1`, `g i = (1/2)^i` the left side is `2` and the right
side is `0`.  The summability of the left-hand series is then *derived*, not
assumed.  At the concrete `E^2` carrier of §5--§6 the same binder is
dischargeable upstream and is not carried. -/

/-! ## 3. The ratio `c_{2s}/c_{s/2}`, at the sharp constant `4` -/

/-- **`c_{2s} <= 4 c_{s/2}`, by factorization.**  With `q := 3^{-s/2}` one has
`3^{-2s} = q^4`, hence

```
    c_{2s} = 1 - q^4 = (1-q)(1 + q + q^2 + q^3) <= 4(1-q) = 4 c_{s/2} .
```

Only `0 <= s` is used (through `q <= 1`); no upper bound on `s`, no
`Real.log 3`, and no transcendental estimate of any kind enters.

`4` is the least uniform constant: the ratio `c_{2s}/c_{s/2}` tends to `4` as
`s -> 0+`.  prints `5.2`, which is true but not sharp; the sharp constant is
proved here and the printed one is not forced. -/

`Ch02.geometricWeight (s/4) 2 j = c_{s/2} . 3^{-s j/2}`: the parameter slot of
`E^2` is `s/4` and its exponent slot is `q = 2`, so the series weight carries

assumed. -/

/-! ## 5. The composed form at the `E^2` carrier

`Ch02.homogenizationErrorOnCube_infinity_two_sq_eq_tsum` turns the right-hand
series into the frozen carrier `E^2_{s/4,infty,2}(cu_m; a, a0)` itself.  Its
per-scale factor `maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale (cu_m) (m - j)`
is the printed `max_{z in 3^{m-j} ℤ^d cap cu_m} max_{|e|=1} J(z + cu_{m-j};
a0^{-1/2} e, a0^{1/2} e; a)`.

At this carrier the abstract engine's summability binder is discharged INLINE,
from `0 < s` alone, by the proved upstream
`Ch02.summable_geometricWeight_two_mul_maxDescendantNormalizedBlockResponseAtScale`
(`EllipticityControl.lean`) at `Q := cu_m` and parameter `s/4` — note
`(originCube d m).scale = m` by `rfl`.  Everything below therefore carries no
summability hypothesis: the conditional A of the module docstring's §5 stops at
the abstract engines. -/
