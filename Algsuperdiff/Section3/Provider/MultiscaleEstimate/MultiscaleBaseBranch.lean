# Provider: the frozen multiscale display on the base-case plateau

## THIS — what this module is NOT

This module is **NOT** the `m <= mStar M` branch of the frozen root, and it
**closes no branch of** `p.multiscale.estimate`.  The chartered complementary
branch of the sibling
`Provider.MultiscaleEstimate.multiscale_estimate_of_mStarStar`
(`MultiscaleEstimate/MultiscaleAbsorption.lean`, whose carried premise is
`mStarStar M < m` since the re-gate, option (i)) is now the range `m <=
mStarStar M` — exactly the range proved here.  What is proved here is the
frozen root's body on the strictly smaller range

```text
    m <= mStarStar M
```

(the BASE landmark, `e.mstarstar`), which is where the `m**`-gated base-case
error public consumed below
(`Provider.Base.exists_baseCaseMStarStarErrorConst`) reaches.  That is NOT the
maximal range of the base-case surface: the landmark-free all-scale public
(`Provider.Base.cutoffHomogenizationError_isOneSidedOrlicz_allScale`, the input
of section 3) supports the frozen display on the strictly larger range
`3^{cgamma m} <~ c(d) nu cgamma cstar^{-1} 2^{Cms}`, which reaches strictly
past `mStarStar M` — but, by the same arithmetic recorded in "Why the range
stops at `m**`" below, still falls strictly short of `mStar M`.  The complement
`mStarStar M < m <= mStar M` is **not** covered here; it is covered from the
other side, by re-gating `l.shom.continuity` and its downstream chain at
`mstarstar`, so that the sibling branch covers that band and this module's
range is exactly its complement.  The arithmetic reason why the base-case
surface cannot reach past `m**` is recorded in full in the section "Why the
range stops at `m**`" below.

## What is delivered

`multiscale_estimate_of_le_mStarStar` is the frozen root's statement body
(`Frozen/Section3/MultiscaleEstimate.lean`, between) **verbatim, binder for
binder and amplitude spelling for amplitude spelling**, with ONE premise
inserted:

```text
    m <= mStarStar M ->
```

immediately before `inductionState M (m - 1) E` — the same slot in which the
sibling inserts its `mStarStar M < m`.  Everything else is unchanged: the same
`exists Cms`, the same window `cstar^{-1} eps^{-Cms} <= E`, the same smallness
`cgamma <= (E^{-1})^{10}`, the same `s in [8 cgamma, 1]`, ONE `(Y, Z)` pair
serving the main conjunct AND the refinement clause, and the two amplitudes

```text
    Cms E s^{-1} sqrt(eps cgamma)   and   Cms eps (s^{-1})^2 exp(-E^{-3} cgamma^{-1}) .
```

**Two of the frozen root's binders are carried unconsumed.**
Both are carried because the frozen body's binder list is immutable — deleting
either would produce a different, strictly stronger theorem that no longer fits
the root — but neither is used by the proof:

* the induction state `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.inductionState M (m - 1) E`
  (the base-case error surface is unconditional in the state), and
* the smallness premise `cgamma <= (E^{-1})^{10}`, which occurs exactly once in
  this file, at the `intro` of section 2's proof, and is consumed by nothing.

Both are therefore introduced under underscored names (`_hS`, `_hgammaE`); the
proof is machine-verified to compile verbatim with both binders deleted from
the statement.  That is a strength, not a gap: the display is proved from
strictly less than the root offers, on both counts.

## The route (for the display of section 2)

Three proved publics and one arithmetic comparison; no analysis is re-proved.
Section 3's own input is named in its docstring.

1. `Provider.Base.exists_baseCaseMStarStarErrorConst` — the corrected
   `m <= m**` base-case error tail: a one-sided `Gamma_2` bound (no
   deterministic shift) at the amplitude
   `C . cstarPlus^{-1/2} . cgamma^{1/2} . sqrt(baseLoss d s)` on the
   literal source range `0 < s < 1`.
2. `Provider.Base.isOneSidedOrlicz_cutoffHomogenizationError_of_le`
   — the `s = 1` endpoint of the frozen root's
   closed window `[8 cgamma, 1]`, reached WITHOUT evaluating `baseLoss` at `1`:
   the bound is read at the interior scale `min s (1/2)` and transported up by
   the proved a.e. antitonicity of the observable in `s`
   (`Provider.ErrorComparison.cutoffHomogenizationError_ae_antitone`,
   `e.mathcalE.monotone.ordered`).  The cost is the factor `(min s (1/2))^{-1}
   <= 2 s^{-1}`.
3. `Provider.Scales.sqrt_baseLoss_le` (`Scales/BaseLoss.lean`) and
   `Provider.Base.sqrt_cstar_le_sqrt_cstarPlus` (`Base/InductionStart.lean`,
   `cstar <= c+` from `d cstar <= c+` and `d >= 2`) and
   `Provider.Disorder.cstar_le_three_halves` — the three scalar comparisons.
4. The amplitude comparison (section 1 below).  Writing `K := sqrt (1 + 6 d log
   3)` for the base-loss constant, the delivered constant is `Cms = max 4 (4
   K)`, chosen before every model and scale parameter.

The witnesses are `(Y, Z) = (mathcal E, 0)`: the second lane is not used at all
on this range, so `Z` is identically zero and its `Gamma_{1/2}` tail is
vacuous.  The refinement clause is discharged unconditionally from the same
`Gamma_2` component (its `s <= Cms eps` hypothesis is consumed by nothing),
which is what makes one `(Y, Z)` pair serve both conjuncts.

## Why the range stops at `m**`

Both halves of the deterministic bridge behind the base case
(`Provider.Base.ae_cutoffHomogenizationError_sq_le_cutoffPlateauAmplitude_add_mass`)
are governed by the SAME all-scale core

```text
    nu^{-1} cgamma^{-1/2} 3^{cgamma m}
```

(`Provider.Base.sqrt_cutoffPlateauAmplitude_le_allScale`,
`sqrt_cutoffMassTailScale_le_allScale`), so the best `Gamma_2` amplitude the
base-case surface can produce at scale `m` is `C(d). nu^{-1} cgamma^{-1/2}
3^{cgamma m}. sqrt(baseLoss d s)`.

```text
    m <= mStarStar M :  <= C(d) cstarPlus^{-1/2} cgamma^{1/2}   (the gamma^3 threshold)
    m <= mStar M     :  <= C(d) cstarPlus^{-1/2}                (the gamma^1 threshold)
```

(`Provider.Base.CutoffBaseTailArithmetic`, `allScaleCore_le_mStarStar` and
`allScaleCore_le_mStar`).

```text
    Cms E s^{-1} sqrt(eps cgamma) >= Cms cstar^{-1} cgamma^{1/2} s^{-1}
```

(because `cstar^{-1} eps^{-Cms} <= E` forces `E sqrt(eps) >= cstar^{-1}`), and
`sqrt(baseLoss d s) <= K s^{-1}`.  Hence the comparison needed at scale `m` is

```text
    nu^{-1} cgamma^{-1/2} 3^{cgamma m}  <~  cstar^{-1} cgamma^{1/2} ,
```

i.e. a `cgamma^2` threshold `3^{2 cgamma m} <~ nu^2 cgamma^2 cstar^{-2}`.  The
`m**` threshold (`cgamma^3`) is stronger and clears it — that is this file.  The
`m*` threshold (`cgamma^1`) does NOT: at `m = mStar M` the base-case amplitude
is `cgamma`-free while the frozen target still carries `cgamma^{1/2}`, and
`cgamma` is unbounded below relative to `cstar` (the model constrains only `0 <
cgamma <= 1/4`, `0 < cstar <= 3/2`, and the root's own window constrains
`cgamma` from ABOVE only).  So the gap is a genuine factor `sqrt(cstar / cgamma)
-> infinity`, not a slack loss: no choice of `Cms` closes it, and the plateau
layer cannot reach the range `mStarStar M < m <= mStar M` at all.

**Which step carries the "no choice of `Cms`" conclusion.**  NOT the lower
bound just displayed: the window's own endpoint `eps <= 1/2` makes that lower
bound itself grow like `2^{Cms}` (from `E sqrt(eps) >= cstar^{-1} eps^{-Cms +
1/2} >= cstar^{-1} 2^{Cms - 1/2}`), so a larger `Cms` does inflate the target
and the lower-bound computation alone does not close the question.

```text
    E sqrt(eps cgamma) <= cgamma^{2/5}
```

— in full, `(E sqrt(eps cgamma))^{10} = E^{10} eps^5 cgamma^5 <= E^{10}
cgamma^5 <= cgamma^{-1} cgamma^5 = cgamma^4`, the last step by `cgamma <=
(E^{-1})^{10}`.  Section 3's docstring records the `eps`-free case `E
sqrt(cgamma) <= cgamma^{2/5}` of the same bound.  The ceiling tends to `0` with
`cgamma`, whereas the `m*` collapse above leaves the base-case amplitude
bounded below by a `cgamma`-free, `eps`-free constant.  Ceiling against floor is
the whole argument; the `Cms`-monotone lower bound is only its motivation.
This also subsumes the earlier negative finding about
`Provider.Base.exists_baseCaseMStarErrorConst` (its deterministic shift `2`):
the obstruction is not the shift, it is the amplitude.  In shift-free form: on
the whole range `m <= mStar M` the base-case surface gives a one-sided
`Gamma_2` bound with no deterministic shift and no `cgamma` factor, and that is
the best it gives.

## The situation in the source

* `p.base.case` itself splits exactly here: its `m <= mstarstar` consequence
  `e.basecase.homogenization` is `E <= O_{Gamma_2}(C cstar^{-1/2}
  cgamma^{1/2})` — with the `cgamma^{1/2}` — while its `m <= mstar` consequence
  `e.basecase.diffusivity` is only `E <= 2 + O_{Gamma_2}(C cstar^{-1/2})` —
  shift `2`, no `cgamma`.  The proposition's own final clause starts the
  induction at `mstarstar`, not at `mstar`: "`S(mstarstar, C cstar^{-1/2})` is
  valid" (again).
* The printed proof of `p.multiscale.estimate` never mentions either landmark;
  the gate `m_0 in (mstar, infinity)` is inherited from its ingredients
  (`l.shom.continuity`, `p.propagate.diffusivity.lower. bound`,
  `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`, `p.bfA.multiscalebound`).  NOTE:
  `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` itself is NOT landmark-gated — its statement
  (label, hypotheses) assumes only `m in Z`, `E in [1,infinity)` and the
  validity of `S(m-1,E)`.  What sits is the landmark binder `m - 1 >= mstar` of
  the interior proposition `p.bfA.multiscalebound` (label), from which
  `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` is then deduced.
* The only printed small-`m` device in the whole chain is for
  `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`: "the statement of the proposition is immediate for
  `m <= mstar`".  It works there because that display's leading term is a
  deterministic constant `C`, which is exactly what the shift `2` of
  `e.basecase.diffusivity` supplies.  It cannot be transplanted to
  `e.complete.wrapping`, which has no deterministic term at all.

So the range `mStarStar M < m <= mStar M` is open in the source as printed.
The correction is on the other side: `l.shom.continuity`'s printed
`m0 in (mstar, infty) cap Z` becomes `m0 in (mstarstar, infty) cap Z`, its
proof extended below `mstar` by the two printed devices, and the upstream
integration re-gated the same way.  The analysis above is therefore a record of
what the base-case surface reaches; the band is closed by the re-gated sibling,
not from this side.

/-! ## 2. The display on the base-case plateau -/

/-- **The frozen `p.multiscale.estimate` body on the range `m <= mStarStar M`.**

This is `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.multiscale_estimate`'s statement body
verbatim with the single premise `m <= mStarStar M` inserted immediately before
the induction state.  It is NOT the chartered `m <= mStar M` branch; see the
module header, whose section "Why the range stops at `m**`" records why the
range `mStarStar M < m <= mStar M` is unreachable from the base-case surface.

The proof reads the corrected `m <= m**` base-case tail at the interior scale
`min s (1/2)`, transports it to the closed endpoint `s = 1` by the proved a.e.
antitonicity, and compares amplitudes: the base amplitude `C2 cstarPlus^{-1/2}
cgamma^{1/2} sqrt(baseLoss d (min s (1/2)))` is at most `2 K cstar^{-1/2}
cgamma^{1/2} s^{-1}`, while the two frozen targets are at least `Cms cstar^{-1}
cgamma^{1/2} s^{-1}` by the window gate; with `sqrt(cstar) <= 2` the choice
`Cms = max 4 (4 K)` clears both. -/
