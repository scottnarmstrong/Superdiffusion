# The corrected response-`J` smallness gate on a good cube

This module proves a local version of the display `e.we.can.apply.cg` of ABK26,
the `J`-smallness step of `p.bfA.multiscalebound`:

```
3^{2j} ||grad (k_L - k_j)||_{W̲^{1,infinity}(z+square_j)} 1_{not B(spx)}
  <=  delta_osc c_star^{1/2} gamma^{-1/2} 3^{gamma j}
  <=  2^{-5} C_{(e.J.sensitivity.smallness.condition)}^{-1} sigmabar_j
  <=  C_{(e.J.sensitivity.smallness.condition)}^{-1} lambda_{1/4,2}(z+square_j; a_j) ,
```

and then transfers the last gauge to the exponent the frozen Section 2.4
sensitivity lemmas consume.

## The three inequalities

* The first is the complement control of `e.Bosc.def`, proved as
  `incrementOscGauge_le_oscThreshold` (`IncrementOscillation.lean`).
* The second is the induction-state clause `e.shom.h.bounds` combined with
  `e.delta.osc.choice`, proved as
  `oscThreshold_le_two_pow_neg_nine_mul_inv_lambdaSensitivityConst_mul_sigmaBar`
  (`LambdaSensitivityTwin.lean`), at the `lambda`-sensitivity constant the
  chain below is read against.
  The factor used here is `2^{-9}`, which is below the manuscript's `2^{-5}`.
* The third is the complement of `e.Bloc.def`:
  `lambda^{-1}_{1/4,2}(z+square_j; a_j) <= 10 sigma_j^{-1}`, i.e.
  `sigmabar_j <= 10 lambda_{1/4,2}(z+square_j; a_j)`, which proves the final
  local inequality in the chain
  because `2^{-9} . 10 < 1`.

## The exponent correction

The passage is the exponent monotonicity `e.ellipticities.monotone.ordered` at
`1/4 < 3/8` composed with the translation-and-dilation covariance of
`lambda_{s,q}`, i.e. the general
`lambdaSq_le_unitCubeLambda_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` of `LambdaTransfer.lean`
read at `t = 1/4`; the manuscript's own inequality is the stronger one, so no
strength is lost.

## Why the assembled statements are almost-sure

`e.Bloc.def` is stated against the *measurable representative*
`cubeLowerEllipticityInv` built by `A.mk`, of which no pointwise information is
available; the last inequality of the chain divides by it and so needs its
positivity, which holds almost surely (`cubeLowerEllipticityInv_pos_ae`).  The
same carrier phenomenon already governs `lambda_transfer_ae` in
`LambdaTransfer.lean`.  Every statement below is proved first in pointwise form
with the positivity as an explicit binder, and then almost surely with that
binder discharged.

## Main results

* `sigmaBar_le_ten_mul_cubeLowerEllipticity_of_notMem_badLoc`: the `not B_loc`
  arithmetic.
* `lambda_transfer_quarter_literal`, `lambda_transfer_quarter_ae`: the
  `t = 1/4` instance of the lambda-transfer, in pointwise and in
  almost-sure form.

/-- The complement of `e.Bloc.def` (ABK26), read as a lower bound on the
coarse-grained lower ellipticity: since `lambda^{-1}_{1/4,2}(z+square_j; a_j)

a_j)`. -/
