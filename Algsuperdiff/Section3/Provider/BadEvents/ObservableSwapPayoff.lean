# What the observable body swap buys: the two pointwise payoffs

Two obstructions that were recorded as *structural* in the tree were
obstructions of that representative choice only, and both dissolve.  This
module proves the two consequences.

## The lower leg's grid domination, now pointwise in the sample

Its module docstring recorded the resulting quantifier gap as the lower leg's
open `hgrid` conjunct, and named the fix — "a pointwise-valid representative
for `Observable.cutoffLowerEllipticityInv` (i.e. a change in the observable
layer)".  That change has now been made, so the equality descends at **every**
sample point: `cutoffLowerEllipticityInv_eq_top_add_gridSum`, and with it the
`for all omega, for all L` form
`cutoffLowerEllipticityInv_forall_le_top_add_gridSum`.  The quantifier order
the pointwise `dominates` clause of
`Probability.IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrliczWithWitness` demands is available.

## (b) The off-centre transport of the lower family relation

The *centered-cube* transport of the `hcg` anchoring is definitional after the
observable body swap: both observables reduce to the same clamped literal.
Earlier scope notes, including the corresponding note in
`Provider/Tail/TailSqrt.lean`, said the off-centre half admitted "no defeq
escape", because the only proved translate identity
(`LambdaCovariance.lambdaSq_cutoff_translateCutoffSample`) is a pathwise
equality read at a *different sample*, while the exported observables carried
no pointwise information at all.

They do now.  The exported observables *are* the literals on the source range,
so the pathwise covariance applies to them directly:

```
cubeLowerEllipticityInv M Q L s hs q omega
  = Observable.cutoffLowerEllipticityInv M Q.scale L s hs q
      (translateCutoffSample (triadicCubeShift Q) omega)  ,
```

at every sample point and every cutoff index, with one shift vector
`triadicCubeShift Q` independent of `L`.  Composing with the law invariance
`Cutoff.map_translateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw` (through
`Provider.Stream.isBigOWith_comp_translateCutoffSample`) transports the whole
`IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrliczWithWitness` package from the centered cube to an
arbitrary triadic cube of the same scale, with the witness `Y` replaced by
`Y ∘ translateCutoffSample (triadicCubeShift Q)` and with `b`, `A`, `L0` and the
tail profile unchanged.  This is the per-translate producer of the `hcg` binder
of `EllipticityBranchLow.lean`.

**Scope.**  The local result transports the *statement* from the centered cube
to a translate.  The frozen
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds` is now proved, but it
is not applied in this transport module; the `hcg` binder of
`EllipticityBranchLow.lean` remains a conditional A binder.  A downstream
assembly can now discharge it at the centered cube and use this result at every
translate of that scale, which is exactly the manuscript's own stationarity
reduction (applied).  The upper (`Lambda`) leg is not transported here: only
the lower covariance `lambdaSq_cutoff_translateCutoffSample` is proved, and the
`Lambda` twin would need the `upperLeft` analogue of
`coarseSigmaStarInvMatrixNorm_cutoff_translateCutoffSample`, which is not.

## Main results

* `cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_translateCutoffSample`,
  `cubeLowerEllipticityInv_translateCutoffSample`: the pathwise off-centre
  identification, at the literal and at the exported observable.
* `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrliczWithWitness_cubeLowerEllipticityInv_translate`,
  `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_cubeLowerEllipticityInv_translate`: the off-centre
  transport of the lower family relation, and its existential form.
* `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_cubeLowerEllipticityInv_forall_descendant`: the
  per-translate `hcg` producer, in the `∀ R ∈ descendantsAtScale Q n` shape the
  branch consumes.

/-- **The pathwise off-centre identification, at the exported observable.**  On the
source range `0 < s` the clamp is inert on both sides, so the covariance of the
literals is inherited verbatim.  Before the  body swap no such statement was
available at the exported observables: they were `Classical.choose`-selected
representatives, and no pointwise identity of an off-centre representative with
anything was proved. -/
