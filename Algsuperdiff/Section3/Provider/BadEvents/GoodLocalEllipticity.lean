# The coarse-ellipticity clause of the good local sensitivity event

ABK26 defines, in `e.good.local.events`, for `m, n` integers and a centre `z`,
the good local sensitivity event

```
Q(m,n,z) := { C_sens sup_{L >= n} 3^{2m} ||grad (k_L - k_n)||_{W^{1,infinity}(z+square_m)}
              <= (1/2) C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)}^{-1} 3^{-(1/2)(n-m)_+} sigmaBar_{n-1}
              <= 3^{-(1/4)(n-m)_+} lambda_{1/8,2}(z+square_m; a_n) } .
```

The displayed event is a chain of two inequalities.  This module defines and
proves a local version of the **second** one — the comparison of the middle threshold with the coarse-grained
lower ellipticity of the cutoff field `a_n` on the cube — as a measurable event
`goodLocalEllipticity`, and proves the exact identification of its complement
with the second event of the manuscript's own decomposition of `not Q(m,n,0)`
in the proof of `l.bad.event.lemma`,

```
{ lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(square_m; a_n) sigmaBar_{n-1} > 2 . 3^{(1/4)(n-m)_+}
    C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)} } .
```

## Carrier and constant conventions (recorded)

* The centre `z` is carried by a `TriadicCube d`, exactly as for the bad events
  of `Definitions.lean`: `Q.scale = m` is the cube scale and `cubeSet Q = z +
  square_m` with `z` in `3^m Z^d`.  The manuscript writes `z in R^d`; every
  consumer of `e.good.local.events` instantiates `z` in a triadic lattice, and
  this repository has no multiscale ellipticity observable on off-grid
  translates.
* `C_{(e.cg.ellip.lower)}` is carried as an explicit real parameter `Ccg`.  Its
  source is the constant of `e.cg.ellip.lower` in `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`,
  whose frozen statement
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds` is now proved and
  available to consumers.  This conditional A remains parametrized by `Ccg`;
  downstream assemblies may instantiate it from the frozen export, while every
  statement below that uses it carries `0 < Ccg` explicitly.
* `lambda_{1/8,2}(z+square_m; a_n)` is the measurable representative
  `cubeLowerEllipticity`, defined as the pointwise inverse of the proved
  representative `cubeLowerEllipticityInv` of `lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}`.  Since
  `Ch02.lambdaSq` is a real number and the literal observable is its inverse,
  the double inverse is the literal `lambda` exactly
  (`cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_inv_eq`).

## Main definitions

* `scaleGapPos`: the manuscript's positive part `(n - m)_+`.
* `cubeLowerEllipticity`: measurable representative of `lambda_{s,q}(Q; a_r)`.
* `goodLocalThreshold`: the middle term
  `(1/2) Ccg^{-1} 3^{-(1/2)(n-m)_+} sigmaBar_{n-1}` of `e.good.local.events`.
* `goodLocalEllipticity`: the second inequality of `e.good.local.events`, as an
  event.

## Main results

* `cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_pos`, `cubeLowerEllipticityInv_pos_ae`.
* `measurable_cubeLowerEllipticity`, `cubeLowerEllipticity_ae_eq_literal`,
  `cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_inv_eq`.
* `measurableSet_goodLocalEllipticity`.
* `notMem_goodLocalEllipticity_iff`: the exact equivalence with the
  manuscript's coarse-ellipticity failure event, at a point where the
  representative of `lambda^{-1}` is positive.
* `compl_goodLocalEllipticity_ae_eq`, `measureReal_compl_goodLocalEllipticity`:
  the same identification almost everywhere, and the resulting equality of
  probabilities — the first reduction in the proof of `l.bad.event.lemma`.
