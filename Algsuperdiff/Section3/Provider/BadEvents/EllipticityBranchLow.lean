# The coarse-ellipticity branch of `l.bad.event.lemma` at `n < m`

`BadEventLemmaCases.lean` supplies a conditional local result for the
coarse-ellipticity branch of ABK26's
Lemma `l.bad.event.lemma` on the branch `n >= m`.  This module supplies a
conditional local result for the *other* branch, `n < m`:

```
lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(square_m ; a_n)
  <= max_{z in 3^n Z^d cap square_m} lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(z + square_n ; a_n) ,
```
then `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` at each translate and `l.maximums.Gamma.s`.

## The two corrections this branch runs under

* **The printed max form is false at finite `q`.**  Definition (2.23) puts a
  sum of per-depth maxima on the left and a maximum of sums on the right, and
  the printed step fails by `3^{2(m-n)(d/q-s)}`, unbounded in the separation.
  The consuming step is routed instead through the true `q = infinity` max form
  and exponent monotonicity, reading the coarse-graining input at a fixed
  `t < s`; the canonical instantiation is `t = 1/16`.  This module consumes the
  proved gap-constant route (sharp only relative to the geometric profile)
  `ErrorComparison.lambdaSq_eighth_inv_le_two_mul_max_descendants_sixteenth`
  (`lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(Q) <= 2 max_{R in descendantsAtScale Q n}
  lambda^{-1}_{1/16,2}(R)`, gap constant `G(1/8,1/16,2) = 1 + 3^{-1/8} <= 2`).

  This is exactly the accounting recorded in the header of
  `FiniteQTransfer.lean`.

* **The entropy of the `3^{d(m-n)}` translates is NOT absorbed by an adjusted
  constant.**  ABK26 says "the constant `c` is adjusted to absorb the polynomial
  factor `3^{d(m-n)}` from the union bound".  A dimension-only `c` cannot do
  that: the loss grows with `m - n` while the double exponential `exp(-exp(c
  E^{-2} gamma^{-1}))` does not.  Accordingly the headline theorem here,
  `measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_translateCoarseBounds`, is stated
  with **no gate at all** and **carries** the loss,

  ```
  P[ lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(square_m; a_n) sigmabar_{n-1} > 2 . 2 Ccg ]
    <= 3^{d(m-n)} exp( - exp( (1/4) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) ) ,
  ```

  and the passage to the printed shape is a separate, explicitly gated step
  (`..._of_absorb`, `..._printed_of_gap`), whose gate

  ```
  d (m - n) log 3 + T <= exp( (1/4) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} )
  ```

  is the exact and only inequality the absorption needs.  Nothing in this
  module hides it: the loss-carrying theorem is unconditional, and every
  printed-shape statement carries the gate as a named binder.

## The size of the gate

The gate above is a genuine restriction on `m - n`, not a constant adjustment.
Two remarks fix its size.

* It is *much* weaker than the self-consistent restriction imposed on the
  oscillation branch at `n < m` (`3^{5(m-n)_+} <= c c_star gamma^{-1}`, i.e.
  `m - n <~ log_3(gamma^{-1})/5`), because here `m - n` may grow like
  `exp(c E^{-2} gamma^{-1})`, doubly exponentially larger.
* The union bound wins because the per-translate tail is *doubly* exponential
  while the loss is only exponential in `m - n`; that is the whole reason a
  gate on `m - n` suffices and no adjustment of the constant is needed.

## The two conditional binders

* `hcg` is the conclusion of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` **at every translate**
  `R in descendantsAtScale Q n`, at `sigma = 1/2`, `s = 1/16`, `q = 2`, in the
  exact shape of the frozen
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds` conclusion but with
  the centered observable `Observable.cutoffLowerEllipticityInv M n L ...`
  replaced by the general-cube observable `cubeLowerEllipticityInv M ...`.  Two
  things are carried by this single binder, both of them steps the manuscript
  itself takes:

  1. the helper keeps the frozen theorem's specialization explicit as a
     conditional A binder, exactly as in `BadEventLemmaCases.lean`; the frozen
     theorem is now proved and may discharge the centered instance in a
     downstream assembly;
  2. the manuscript applies the proposition *at each translate* `z + square_n`,
     which is its own stationarity reduction; the frozen statement is at the
     centered cube.  On the centered cube `R = originCube d n` the two
     observables agree almost everywhere
     (`cubeLowerEllipticityInv_ae_eq_cutoffLowerEllipticityInv`); note however
     that this a.e. identification does NOT by itself transport the frozen
     conclusion to this binder even at that one translate, because
     `IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrliczWithWitness.dominates` is a pointwise (`∀ ω`)
     clause, which an a.e. route cannot reach.  Both halves are resolved below.

     * *Centered.*  The exported general-cube and centered observables both
       reduce pointwise to the same literal by
       `cubeLowerEllipticityInv_eq_literal`,
       `Observable.cutoffLowerEllipticityInv_eq_literal`, and
       `cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_originCube`.  Hence the family relation
       transports with the same witness and no null-set surgery.
     * Since the observable bodies are the literals clamped
       at `0`, the exported observables carry pointwise
       information, and the proved pathwise covariance
       `LambdaCovariance.lambdaSq_cutoff_translateCutoffSample` applies to them
       directly: `cubeLowerEllipticityInv M s hs q omega` equals the centered
       observable at scale `R.scale` read at the translated sample
       (`ObservableSwapPayoff.cubeLowerEllipticityInv_translateCutoffSample`).
       With the law invariance
       `Cutoff.map_translateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw` this produces the
       WHOLE `∀ R ∈ descendantsAtScale Q n` binder from a SINGLE centered
       instance at scale `n` (`ObservableSwapPayoff`'s
       `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_cubeLowerEllipticityInv_forall_descendant`),
       which is precisely the manuscript's stationarity reduction.

     The binder remains as stated because this module exposes the translated
     statement rather than assembling its upstream input.  The frozen theorem
     discharges the centered instance, and the *transport* is what is proved
     here.

  The exponent is `1/16`, not the printed `1/8`, by the `q = infinity` reading
  described above.  `1/16` lies
  in the frozen `s`-window `Set.Icc (gamma/2 + exp(-Ccg^{-1} E^{-2}
  gamma^{-1})) 1` exactly when `gamma/2 + exp(-Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1}) <=
  1/16`, the `t = 1/16` analogue of the proved `s = 1/8` gate; that gate is a
  *precondition of the frozen theorem*, discharged where the binder is
  discharged, and therefore appears nowhere here.

* `hgamma : gamma <= 1/16` makes the frozen deterministic profile
  `lowerEllipticityProfile Ccg gamma (1/16) 2 = Ccg (1/16) (1/8 - gamma)^{-1}`
  at most `Ccg`.  It is not an addition: `gamma_le_one_sixteenth_of_admissible`
  derives it from the manuscript's own admissibility
  `e.bad.event.admissibility` at the dimension-only constant
  `badEventOscAdmissibleConst`, exactly as the proved `n >= m` branch derives
  `gamma <= 1/8` (both come from `gamma <= E^{-5} <= 1/32`).

## Main results

* `lowerEllipticityProfile_exponentTwo_eq`,
  `lowerEllipticityProfile_exponentTwo_sixteenth_le`,
  `gamma_le_one_sixteenth_of_admissible`: the deterministic profile at
  `s = 1/16`.
* `cubeLowerEllipticityInv_le_two_mul_finsetSupReal_ae`: the transfer, at the
  observables (stated almost everywhere; the underlying fact is in fact
  pointwise --- see the structure note at that theorem).
* `measureReal_translateCoarseEllipticityTail_le`: the per-translate tail.
* `measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_translateCoarseBounds`: the
  branch, loss-carrying and gate-free.
* `measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_absorb`,
  `measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_printed_of_gap`: the printed shape,
  under the explicit entropy gate.

/-! ## The transfer at the observable level

`ErrorComparison.lambdaSq_eighth_inv_le_two_mul_max_descendants_sixteenth` is a
statement about the literal `Ch02.lambdaSq` of a triadic coefficient family, and
holds pointwise in the sample.

The observable bodies are the literals
clamped at `0`, so `cubeLowerEllipticityInv M Q n s hs q` **is**
`cubeLowerEllipticityInvLiteral M Q n s q` on the source range `s > 0`
(`cubeLowerEllipticityInv_eq_literal`), and the transfer descends at every
sample point.  The same applies to the a.e. route of `LambdaTransfer.lean`. -/

/-! ## The branch, loss-carrying and gate-free -/

/-- **The case `n < m` of the coarse-ellipticity branch** (ABK26), with the
union loss carried:

```
P[ lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(square_m; a_n) sigmabar_{n-1} > 2 . (2 Ccg) ]
  <= 3^{d(m-n)} exp( - exp( (1/4) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) ) .
```

There is no hypothesis on `m - n`: the cardinality of the translate set appears
in the conclusion, where the manuscript puts it into an "adjusted" constant `c`,
which a dimension-only `c` cannot absorb.  The passage to the printed shape is
`measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_absorb`.

The constant `2 Ccg` at which the failure event is read is the `Ccg` re-basing
(gap route, `G <= 2`); `hcg` is the coarse-graining input at every translate,
at the exponent `t = 1/16`. -/

translates fits under the per-translate double exponent with room `T` to spare,
the branch is delivered at the level `exp(-T)`.

The hypothesis `hAbsorb` is *the* inequality the manuscript's needs and does not
state; by `log_card_descendantsAtScale` it reads

```
d (m - n) log 3 + T <= exp( (1/4) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) .
```

It is a restriction on the scale separation `m - n`, not a constant adjustment. -/

at `Ccg^{-1}/8`).
