# The umbrella of `l.bad.event.lemma`, re-assembled through both ellipticity branches

`BadEventLemmaFull.measureReal_compl_goodLocalEvent_le_full_of_coarseBounds`
assembles ABK26's `e.bad.event.Q.estimate` over the full range of `m, n`, but
it routes **both** branches of the coarse-ellipticity half through
`BadEventLemmaCases.measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_coarseBounds`,
which is the branch `n ≥ m`.  On the other branch that is a degeneracy, not a
generalization:

```
n < m = Q.scale   ⟹   scaleGapPos Q.scale n = 0
                  ⟹   3^{(1/4) scaleGapPos Q.scale n} = 1 ,
```

The umbrella is therefore vacuous on `n < m`.  The collapse itself is
machine-checked here (`three_rpow_scaleGapPos_eq_one_of_lt`), so the diagnosis
is not commentary.

This module supplies the missing import edge and re-assembles the umbrella so
that **each branch is served by its own conditional Provider A**.

## The shape of the re-assembly, and why the constant is re-based

`EllipticityBranchLow` delivers its branch at the re-based constant `2 Ccg`
(the gap constant `G(1/8,1/16,2) ≤ 2` of the transfer), i.e. it bounds
`coarseEllipticityFailure M (2 Ccg) Q n`.  The umbrella below is therefore
stated at the good local event `Q(m,n,z)` read at `2 Ccg`, on **both**
branches.  On `n ≥ m` the re-basing costs nothing beyond monotonicity of the
failure event in the constant (`coarseEllipticityFailure_two_mul_subset`,
proved here), so the proved `n ≥ m` branch is consumed at its own constant
`Ccg` and its own binder shape, verbatim.

The two branches deliver different double exponents --- `Ccg^{-1}/4` on `n ≥ m`,
`Ccg^{-1}/8` on `n < m` (the gate's own budget) --- and the umbrella is stated at
the weaker of the two, `Ccg^{-1}/8`, exactly as `EllipticityBranchLow`'s header
predicts.  The `n ≥ m` branch alone remains available at `Ccg^{-1}/4` from
`BadEventLemmaCases`; nothing is lost, and nothing here re-derives either tail.

## The four disclosed conditional binders (no graph status)

Each is **guarded by the branch that needs it**, which is the whole content of
the re-assembly:

* `hmono`, under `Q.scale ≤ n` --- the W cube-monotonicity step.  Under the
  guard the weight `3^{(1/4)(n-m)_+}` is genuine, so the binder is not the
  refuted weight-free statement.  On `n < Q.scale` it is **not assumed at
  all**.
* `hcgHigh`, under `Q.scale ≤ n` --- the conclusion of the frozen
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds` at the centered
  observable, `sigma = 1/2`, `s = 1/8`, `q = 2`, verbatim the binder of
  `BadEventLemmaCases.lean`.
* `hcgLow`, under `n < Q.scale` --- the same frozen conclusion at every
  translate `R ∈ descendantsAtScale Q n` and at the exponent `t = 1/16`,
  verbatim the binder of `EllipticityBranchLow.lean`.

`hrestrict` is the restriction, already guarded by `n < Q.scale` in
`BadEventLemmaFull`, forwarded unchanged.

## The `1 ≤ Ccg` normalization, named precisely

Both branches need `1 ≤ Ccg`, and the frozen `coarse_ellipticity_bounds`
supplies only a positive constant.  The binding constraint is the **low**
branch: its per-translate tail is read at the level `Ccg /
exp(-Ccg^{-1}E^{-2}gamma^{-1})`, which must be `≥ 1` for the weak-Orlicz tail
to apply, and that is exactly `1 ≤ Ccg`
(`EllipticityBranchLow.measureReal_translateCoarseEllipticityTail_le`).  The
high branch needs only `1 ≤ 2 Ccg`.  So the re-assembly **inherits** `1 ≤ Ccg`
unchanged from the two proved branches and adds nothing; it is discharged only
after the frozen theorem is proved with its own choice of constant, exactly as
`BadEventLemmaCases.lean` records.  No step here is blocked by the gap, and no
step here weakens it.

For the record, the gap looks closable in one lemma, which is **not** built
here (it belongs in `Section3/Probability/LowerFamily.lean`, not in a bad-event
umbrella, and it changes how the frozen conclusion is consumed): re-basing the
frozen constant to `max 1 Ccg` needs `IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz` monotone
upward in the deterministic profile `b` (immediate from its `dominates` clause,
`X L ω ≤ b + Y ω`) and in the Orlicz scale `A` (CoarseGraining's proved
`IndependentSums.IsBigOWith.mono_scale`), together with monotonicity of
`lowerEllipticityProfile Ccg gamma s 2 = Ccg s (2s-gamma)^{-1}` in `Ccg`.
Until that lemma exists, `1 ≤ Ccg` stays a binder here, as it already is
upstream.

## What is *not* proved

* **No discharge of `hmono`.**  The centered-cube discharge sketched in
  `BadEventLemmaCases.lean` (`ErrorComparison.lambdaSq_originCube_eighth_le`) is
  a statement about the literal `Ch02.lambdaSq`, not about the inverse
  observables the binder is written against; converting it needs a positivity
  and inversion step that is not performed here.
* **No claim about the printed `B_osc`.**  The oscillation half below is the
  proved `goodLocalSensitivityFailure`, i.e. by definition the complement of
  the event's own first clause (`compl_goodLocalSensitivity_eq`).  The census's
  on the oscillation bound of `l.bad.event.lemma` (the proved event may be a proper
  subset of the printed `B_osc`) is **not** relied on in either direction:
  nothing here asserts that the two events coincide.
* **No sharpening.**  `Ccg^{-1}/8`, `2 Ccg` and `badEventOscLowConst` are the
  proved constants; nothing is optimized.

## Main results

* `coarseEllipticityFailure_two_mul_subset`.
* `measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_two_mul_le_of_coarseBounds`: the branch
  `n ≥ m` at the re-based constant and the reconciled exponent.
* `measureReal_compl_goodLocalEvent_le_full_reassembled`: the umbrella over the
  full range, each branch served by its own conditional Provider A.

/-! ## The branch `n ≥ m`, at the re-based constant and the reconciled exponent -/

/-- **The case `n ≥ m` of the coarse-ellipticity branch**, read at the re-based
constant `2 Ccg` and at the exponent `Ccg^{-1}/8` at which the two branches
meet:

```
P[ lambda^{-1}_{1/8,2}(z+square_m; a_n) sigmabar_{n-1} > 2 . 3^{(1/4)(n-m)_+} (2 Ccg) ]
  <= exp( - exp( (1/8) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) ) .
```

Both weakenings are theorems: the event shrinks when the constant is doubled
(`coarseEllipticityFailure_two_mul_subset`), and `exp((1/8)X) ≤ exp((1/4)X)` for
`X ≥ 0`.  The binders are those of
`BadEventLemmaCases.measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_of_coarseBounds`,
verbatim and at the un-re-based `Ccg`. -/

/-! ## The umbrella over the full range, each branch on its own conditional A -/

/-- **`l.bad.event.lemma` over the full range of `m, n`, re-assembled** (ABK26,
`e.bad.event.Q.estimate`), at the re-based constant `2 Ccg`:

```
P[ not Q(m,n,z) ]
  <= exp( - c c_star gamma^{-1} 3^{-5(m-n)_+} 3^{(n-m)_+} )
     + exp( - exp( (1/8) Ccg^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) ) ,
```

with `c = badEventOscLowConst d (2 Ccg)`, dimension-only.

Unlike
`BadEventLemmaFull.measureReal_compl_goodLocalEvent_le_full_of_coarseBounds`,
the coarse-ellipticity half is served on `n < Q.scale` by
`EllipticityBranchLow.measureReal_coarseEllipticityFailure_le_printed_of_gap`
rather than by the `n ≥ m` branch, whose `hmono` binder degenerates there to a
refuted statement (`three_rpow_scaleGapPos_eq_one_of_lt`).  Accordingly `hmono`
and the centered `hcg` are hypothesised only under `Q.scale ≤ n`, and the
translate `hcg` and the entropy gate only under `n < Q.scale`.

The two `hcg` binders have the shape of specializations of the proved
`p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`, but this statement does not itself perform their
translated-carrier discharge; `hgap` and `hrestrict` restrict the two
branches. -/
