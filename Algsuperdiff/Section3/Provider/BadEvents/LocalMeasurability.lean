# Point values of a shell field are integral-local

The manuscript's local information `F(U)` is represented on the shell carrier by
the integral-generated `ShellField.lihLocalSigma U`, whose generators are the
entry tests `j ↦ ∫ j(x)_{ik} φ(x) dx` of probes `φ` supported in `U`
(`Algsuperdiff.Assumptions.ShellField.LIHLocalSigma`).  Every gauge of Section
3.3 — the oscillation gauges `localCubeDerivNorm`, `localCubeSecondDerivNorm`
of `e.BoscL.def` in particular — is a supremum of *pointwise* quantities, so
the first thing needed to place those gauges in a local σ-algebra is that a
single point value

`j ↦ j(x)`

is `lihLocalSigma U`-measurable whenever `x` is an interior point of `U`.

This module proves exactly that.  No mollification is required: on the shell
carrier the value map `x ↦ j(x)` is *continuous* by construction, so the
closed-ball averages

`⨍_{B(x,ρ)} j(y)_{ik} dy`

converge to `j(x)_{ik}` as `ρ ↓ 0` for **every** `j` (no Lebesgue
differentiation, no null set), while each of them is a scalar multiple of the
CoarseGraining entry test against the ball indicator — a probe supported in `U`
as soon as the ball is contained in `U`.  A pointwise limit of measurable
functions is measurable, which gives the claim.

## Main results

* `tendsto_setAverage_closedBall`: shrinking closed-ball averages of a
  continuous function converge to its value at the centre.
* `measurable_entry_eval_lihLocalSigma`: each scalar entry `j ↦ j(x)_{ik}` is
  `lihLocalSigma U`-measurable at every interior point `x` of `U`.
* `tendsto_diffQuotient_deriv`: the difference quotients of the values along a
  direction converge to the stored first derivative applied to that direction.
* `measurable_entry_eval_deriv_lihLocalSigma`,
  `measurable_eval_deriv_apply_lihLocalSigma`: the directional first derivative
  `j ↦ (∇j)(x)v` is `lihLocalSigma U`-measurable at every interior point `x`
  of `U`.  The difference quotients only read values at points of the ball
  around `x` already contained in `U`, so no information outside `U` is used.

/-! ## Shrinking ball averages of a continuous function -/

/-- Averages of a continuous real function over closed balls of radii tending
to zero converge to its value at the common centre.  This is elementary — it
uses only that a closed ball has positive finite volume and that the average of
a function with values in a closed interval lies in that interval — and in
particular it holds at *every* point, not almost everywhere. -/
