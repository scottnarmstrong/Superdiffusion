# The local bad-event probability `e.Bloc.prob`

This module proves the local branch of ABK26's Lemma `l.bad.event.probabilities`
(statement, proof Step 1): for every integer scale `j <= m - 1` and every centre
`z` in `3^j Z^d`,

```
P[ B_loc(z + square_j) ] <= exp( - c E^{-2} gamma^{-1} ) ,
```

with the explicit dimension-free `c = 1/512`.

## The proof

*Step 1* of the manuscript reads: by `e.bound.Lambdas.by.Es`,
`sigma_j^{-1} Lambda_{1/4,2}(z+square_j; a_j) <= 4 + 4 E^2` and similarly for
`sigma_j lambda_{1/4,2}^{-1}`; hence by Markov and the induction hypothesis
`e.new.induction.for.shom`, the probability is at most `exp(-c E^{-2}gamma^{-1})`.

Here the two halves are:

* `CenteredIdentification.measureReal_badLoc_le_measureReal_centeredTail`
  (the sharp comparison, the deterministic translation covariance of
  `TranslationCovariance.lean`, and the translation invariance of the cutoff
  sample law) reduces to `P[ E_{1/4,infinity,2}(square_j; a_j, sigma_j) > 1 ]`;
* the second clause of the induction state
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.inductionState` at `s = 1/4` gives the two-term
  weak-Orlicz bound
  `E_{1/4,infinity,2}(square_j) <= O_{Gamma_2}(4 E gamma^{1/2}) +
  O_{Gamma_{1/2}}(16 exp(-E^{-3}gamma^{-1}))`, and the two tails are evaluated
  at the levels `t_1 = (2 A_1)^{-1}`, `t_2 = (2 A_2)^{-1}` splitting the
  threshold `1 = 1/2 + 1/2`.

The first tail contributes `exp(-E^{-2}gamma^{-1}/64)`, the second
`exp(-(exp(E^{-3}gamma^{-1})/32)^{1/2})`, and the second is far smaller than the
first in the admissible range.

## The admissibility gate

Both weak-Orlicz tails are only available at levels `t >= 1`, so the amplitudes
must be below the threshold: `8 E gamma^{1/2} <= 1`.  With `gamma <= E^{-5}`
this reads `8 E^{-3/2} <= 1`, i.e. `E >= 4`.  Likewise `s = 1/4` lies in the
induction state's window `[8 gamma, 1]` only when `gamma <= 1/32`, which again
needs a lower bound on `E`.  The lower bound is therefore carried explicitly
here as `4 <= E`; it is exactly what `E >= C(d) c_star^{-1}` yields at `C(d):=
4 C_0(d)` for any dimension-only `c_star <= C_0(d)`.

## Main results

* `measureReal_upperTail_le_of_isTwoTermBigOWith`: the union bound for a
  two-term weak-Orlicz relation.
* `measureReal_badLoc_le`: the displayed bound `e.Bloc.prob`.
