# Provider: the per-cube fluctuation arithmetic of Step 2

Source displays in ABK26, inside Step 2 of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`:

* The Euler--Lagrange identity followed by the block Besov duality bound

  ```
  fint tilde S_z . bfA_m tilde S_z
    = fint bfF_z . bfA_m tilde S_z
    <= [bfAhom^{1/2} bfF_z]_{H^1} [bfAhom^{-1/2} bfA_m tilde S_z]_{H^{-1}} ;
  ```

* The doubled coarse-grained Poincare inequality `e.CG.Poincare.doubled.vars`,
which bounds the `H^{-1}` factor **linearly** in `|| bfA_m^{1/2} tilde S_z ||`;
* The resulting bound on `|| bfA_m^{1/2} tilde S_z ||` itself, obtained by
  cancelling one power, and the companion cross-term bound for `P_z. fint bfA_m
  tilde S_z`;
* The display `e.lower.bound.localization.terms`, whose bracketed integrand is
  `2 P_z. fint bfA_m tilde S_z + fint tilde S_z. bfA_m tilde S_z`.

## Scope: arithmetic only

Everything below is **abstract real arithmetic** over bare real variables.  No
cube, no seminorm, no coefficient field, no minimizer and no gauge occurs, and
this module imports nothing but `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Pow.Real`.
The three analytic inputs of the displays above --- the block Besov duality
bound, the doubled coarse-grained Poincare inequality, and the Euler--Lagrange
identity that supplies the quadratic value --- appear here only as the named
real hypotheses `hquad`, `hpoin`, `hquadval` and `hcross`.  Each is a caller
obligation, to be discharged by the caller at whatever carrier it works on;
this module neither states nor proves any of them.  Isolating the algebra here
keeps every numeric tactic away from `Real.rpow` terms.

Under the intended instantiation `blockE = || bfA_m^{1/2} tilde S_z ||`,
`E = fint tilde S_z . bfA_m tilde S_z / 2`,
`Bu = [bfAhom^{-1/2} bfA_m tilde S_z]_{H^{-1}}`,
`Bg = [bfAhom^{1/2} bfF_z]_{H^1}`, `normP = | bfAhom^{1/2} P_z |`, `kappa` the
block Besov duality constant and `Theta` the doubled-Poincare ellipticity
factor.

nonnegative multiple of itself is dominated by that multiple.  This is the step
that turns a quadratic bound plus a linear Poincare bound into a bound on the

/-- **The self-improved bound on `|| bfA_m^{1/2} tilde S_z ||`, over abstract
reals.**  If the doubled energy `E` satisfies the duality bound `2E ≤ kappa (Bu
Bg)`, the Poincare bound `Bu ≤ Theta blockE` holds, and
`blockE² = 2E`, then `blockE ≤ kappa Theta Bg`.

/-- **The bracketed integrand, per cube, over abstract reals.** Combining the
cross-term bound, the duality bound coming from the Euler--Lagrange identity
and the Poincare self-improvement:

```
2 P_z . fint bfA_m tilde S_z + fint tilde S_z . bfA_m tilde S_z
  <= 2 kappa Theta² normP Bg + (kappa Theta Bg)² .
```

Both summands carry exactly the manuscript's power of the ellipticity factor:
once in the cross term and once in the quadratic term.
