# The self-similar coarse-graining estimate: the Section 3 root

ABK26, `p.induction.bounds` (printed proof):

## Main result

* `induction_bounds_provided`: the body of the draft
  `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.induction_bounds`, with the identical binder
  list `(d : ℕ)` and the identical `∃ C`-statement.  The draft module is
  deliberately NOT in this file's import closure.

## The assembly

Three inputs, all of them proved or here, each consumed exactly once:

1. `Provider.Base.base_case d` (`Provider/Base/BaseCaseAssembly.lean`) -- its
   LAST clause `∃ Estart, (Estart: ℝ) = Cstart (sqrt c_star)^{-1} ∧
   inductionState M (mStarStar M) Estart` is the induction start `S(m**, Cstart
   c_star^{-1/2})`.  Its first three clauses (the all-scale error, the
   `m**`-window and the `m*`-window plateaus) are NOT consumed.
2. The draft root itself is never imported.
3. `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.diffusivity_asymptotics d`
   (`Frozen/Section3/DiffusivityAsymptotics.lean`, the frozen
   `p.propagate.diffusivity.lower.bound`) -- its conclusion, the sharp defect
   display `e.formula.for.shom` on the window `∀ m ≤ m0`, is the ingredient of
   the second root conjunct.  Its 2nd and 3rd conclusions (the `sigmaBar`
   sandwich at `m0`) are NOT consumed here; they are consumed inside input 2.

The exported constant is chosen B the universally quantified model.  Write
`Cstart`, `Cstep`, `Cflow` for the three inputs' own constants, and set

`K := max (max 6 (Cstart sqrt(3/2))) (max Cstep Cflow)`,  `C := 2 K^3`.

Each of the four demands on `K` is met by construction and is discharged where
it is used:

* `Cstart sqrt(3/2) ≤ K` -- the base bridge `startBudget_le_of_sqrt`
  (`StateCalculus.lean`): `Cstart c_star^{-1/2} ≤ K c_star^{-1}`, the budget
  bump, proved (not assumed) from the proved `cstar_le_three_halves`.
* `Cstep ≤ K` -- the gate `Cstep c_star^{-1} ≤ E` of the one-scale step.
* `Cflow ≤ K` -- the gate `Cflow c_star^{-1} ≤ E` of the diffusivity root, used
  for the second conjunct.

Per model `M` the terminal budget is `E := K c_star^{-1}`.  The root's own
premise `gamma ≤ (C^{-1})^{10} c_star^{10}` at `C = 2K^3` yields both regimes
actually needed, `gamma ≤ (K^{-1})^{10} c_star^{10}` (for the absorption) and
`gamma ≤ (E^{-1})^{10}` (for the two gates), because `K ≤ 2K^3` and
`(E^{-1})^{10} = (K^{-1})^{10} c_star^{10}`.  The iteration
`inductionState_of_base_of_step_of_E_le` (`StateCalculus.lean`) then gives `S(m,
E)` `m : ℤ`.

**Constant reconciliation.**  All four `C`-slots of the frozen root compose at
the single witness `C = 2K^3`: the regime is a, so the larger constant is the
stronger hypothesis (and it implies the regime at `K` since `K ≤ 2K^3` for `K ≥
6`); the `Gamma_2` amplitude, the `Gamma_{1/2}` exponent and the `sigmaBar`
defect bound are all U bounds, so the larger constant is the weaker conclusion.

## The gap in the printed proof that this module fills

The printed proof of `p.induction.bounds` proves exactly `S(m, C c_star^{-1})`
for every `m ∈ Z` and then stops.  The printed proof never performs that
extraction: `p.propagate.diffusivity.lower.bound` is invoked only for
`e.shom.h.bounds`, and its sharp first conclusion is dropped.  Section 9 below,
`exists_sigmaBar_formula`, supplies it: it re-invokes the
`diffusivity_asymptotics` at the auxiliary top scale `m0:= max m (mStar M + 1)`
(legal for every `m ∈ Z`, since the root's gate is `mStar M < m0` and its
defect conclusion is a `∀ m ≤ m0` window) and reads off the display at the
requested `m`.  No new mathematics is introduced: the whole content is the
landmark bookkeeping the print omits.

/-! ## 9. The sharp `sigmaBar` formula at every scale

The step the printed proof omits (see the module header).  The
`diffusivity_asymptotics` delivers its sharp defect display as a `∀ m ≤ m0`
window under the landmark gate `mStar M < m0`.  Both are satisfied at once, for
an arbitrary requested scale `m`, by the auxiliary top scale `m0:= max m (mStar
M + 1)`; the state at `m0 - 1` comes from the all-scale iteration supplied by
the caller. -/

/-- **`e.formula.for.shom` scale**, from the `p.propagate.diffusivity.lower.bound`
and the all-scale induction state.

The only device is the landmark bookkeeping: apply the root at `m0 = max m
(mStar M + 1) > mStar M` and read its first conclusion at `m ≤ m0`.  No
amplitude is changed, so the constant is the root's own. -/

/-! ## 10. The root -/

/-- **`p.induction.bounds`: the self-similar coarse-graining estimate.**

The exported constant is `C = 2 K^3` with `K = max (max 6 (Cstart sqrt(3/2)))
(max Cstep Cflow)`, chosen after the three inputs' own constants and before
every model datum.  Under the printed regime `gamma ≤ C^{-10} c_star^{10}` the
induction runs at the terminal budget `E = K c_star^{-1}` from the base scale
`m**` through the one-scale propagation, giving `S(m, E)` at every `m : ℤ`; the
first root conjunct is then the proved `s`-free re-wrapping of the state's
error clause, and the second is the sharp defect display of the diffusivity
root, read at every scale through §9.

This is a proved local Provider helper.  Its statement is the body of the draft
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.induction_bounds`; the draft module is
deliberately NOT in this file's import closure. -/
