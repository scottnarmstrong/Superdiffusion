# Provider: variational simplex subadditivity (`l.subadd.betterer`)

This file is a finite-carrier candidate/provider implementation for Lemma
`l.subadd.betterer` and its display `e.subadd.betterer` of ABK26.

for a partition `SW` of a cube `cu_m` into (triadic) simplices and a family of
piecewise-affine competitors `hat-linear_p`, `hat-D_q` satisfying the displayed
boundary conditions `e.hat.linear.1` and `e.hat.D.bc`,

```
  (p,q) . bfA(cu_m; a) (p,q)
    <= sum_{s in SW} (|s| / |cu_m|) (grad hat-linear_p (s), div hat-D_q (s))
         . bfA(s; a) (grad hat-linear_p (s), div hat-D_q (s)).
```

## Carrier choices

* `bfA(U; a)` is CoarseGraining's `Homogenization.Book.Ch02.coarseBlockMatrix U
  a`, whose defining property
  `Homogenization.Book.Ch02.DoubledMuTheory.doubledMu_eq_coarseBlockMatrix` is
  exactly the paper's `e.bigA.def` `mu(U,P) = 1/2 P . bfA(U) P`, with `mu(U,P)
  = doubledMu U a P` the paper's `e.variational.mu.U.P`: the infimum of `⨍_U
  1/2 X. bfA X` over `X ∈ P + L²_pot,0(U) × L²_sol,0(U)`.

* The partition `SW` is carried by a finite family `S : ι → Domain d` of
  subdomains of `Q`, pairwise disjoint, whose union exhausts `Q` up to a
  Lebesgue-null set.  Open triadic simplices of a triangulation of `cu_m` are
  exactly of this form (an open simplex is an open bounded convex nonempty set,
  distinct open cells of a triangulation are disjoint, and the union of the
  closed cells is the cube, so only the faces — a null set — are missed).  No
  simplicial structure is used by the proof and none is assumed.

  **Finite-carrier form.**  `[Fintype ι]` restricts this file's statement to
  *finite* partitions.  The paper's own Whitney partition `W(cu_m)` and hence
  its simplicial refinement `SW(cu_m)` are countably infinite, and the
  application sums over that infinite family.

* The competitor pair is carried at the level of the two *fields* `F = grad
  hat-linear_p` and `G = div hat-D_q`, through exactly the two displayed
  boundary properties the paper's proof invokes, `F ∈ p + L²_pot,0(cu_m)`
  (`e.hat.linear.1`) and `G ∈ q + L²_sol,0(cu_m)` (`e.hat.D.bc`), together with
  the paper's `e.hat.linear.2`, that these fields are constant on each element
  of the partition, with constant values `Fc i` and `Gc i` — the paper's `grad
  hat-linear_p (s)` and `div hat-D_q (s)`.  This is weaker than the paper's
  hypotheses (it forgets that the fields come from a *linear* family of
  piecewise affine potentials, which the paper's proof never uses), so the
  theorem below implies the paper's statement.
