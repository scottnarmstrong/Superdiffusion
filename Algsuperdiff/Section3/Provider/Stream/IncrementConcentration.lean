# The deterministic partition identity for the stream-increment `L^p` mass

ABK26 proves `e.kl.bounds.large` by writing the cube average `⨍_{cu_l} |k_m -
k_n|^p` as the average of the *subcube* averages over the scale-`m` partition
of `cu_l`, and then applying `p.concentration` to that partition average.  This
module proves the deterministic half of that step — the exact identity —
together with the law-carrier form of the cube observable that the
concentration step consumes.

## What is proved

* `regFieldLpMass p U a` — the volume-normalized `L^p` mass of a *regular
  coefficient field* on an observation set.  This is the CoarseGraining-shaped
  cube observable `X : Set (Vec d) → RegCoeffField d → ℝ`; read at the
  increment field on a half-open triadic cube it is the cube average of the
  increment density (`cubeAverage_streamIncrementLpDensity`), i.e. the proved
  `streamIncrementLpMass`.
* `regFieldLpMass_translateSet` — translating the observation set is the same
  as translating the field.  This is the raw form of the covariance that
  CoarseGraining's restriction lane asks for
  (`Ch04.IsRestrictionTranslationCovariant`), one of the three structural
  hypotheses of
  `isBigO_gammaSigma_restrictionCenteredDescendantAverage_of_restrictionUnitRangeDependentLaw`;
  the lane-shaped statement is carried by the measurable representative
  `regFieldLpMassRep` of `IncrementMassRepresentative.lean`, together with the
  restriction locality (`Ch04.IsRestrictionLocalRandomVariable`) that the same
  module supplies.  What that representative costs is exactly the measurability
  obstruction described in the gap note below.
* `integrableOn_cubeSet_streamIncrementLpDensity` — the `x`-side integrability
  of the density on a half-open triadic cube (the proved `IncrementLp`
  integrability suite is in `omega`, and its `x`-side lemma is stated on the
  *open* cube; CoarseGraining's partition identity needs the half-open one).
* `streamIncrementLpMass_eq_descendantsAverage`,
  `streamIncrementLpMass_eq_descendantAverage_of_scale` — **the deterministic
  descendant identity**, CoarseGraining's
  `cubeAverage_eq_descendantsAverage_cubeAverage_of_integrableOn` instantiated
  at the increment density, in both the depth-indexed and the scale-indexed
  form.
  The *head + centered tail* rewriting of that identity is not performed here.
  The raw centered tail is signed, so it does NOT satisfy the concentration
  interface's `hT_nonneg` directly; a consumer must pass `T := |mass − H|`, to
  which the `Γ` bound transfers since `IsBigOWith` is stated through the
  absolute tail event, and the proved
  `IncrementLpGain.streamIncrementLpMass_head_tail` does exactly that.

## The remaining gap for `e.kl.bounds.large`

The concentration application itself is *not* proved, and needs exactly one
more input, recorded here so the follow-up is bounded:

* `Measurable (regFieldLpMass p U)` on the canonical carrier σ-algebra of
  `RegCoeffField d` (equivalently, an a.e. representative of it in the sense of
  Ch04's restriction-lane centered-descendant-average theorem for an a.e.-equal
  local representative).
  Pointwise evaluation `a ↦ a x i j` is measurable, but the carrier σ-algebra
  is a join containing an uncountable-product part, so the *integral* over `U`
  of a nonlinear function of the values is not measurable for free.  The
  canonical route is a countable local representative: on the (full-measure,
  because every increment field is continuous) set of continuous fields,
  `⨍_U |a|^p` is the limit of the triadic Riemann sums
  `descendantsAverage U j (fun R => |cubeAverageMat R a|^p)`, and each
  `cubeAverageMat R a` is a fixed multiple of `entryTestR i j (1_{cubeSet R})`,
  hence `LocalSigmaR`- and `RestrictionSigmaR`-measurable.

: no rescaling achieves this for the manuscript's scale-`m` subcubes (unit
range and nonnegative subcube scale are incompatible); the local partition runs
at the coarser scale-`(m+c)` subcubes via `Provider/Stream/IncrementLaw.lean`'s
`scaledStreamIncrementLaw` at `3^{m+c}`, `3^c > 2 sqrt d`, costing the
dimension-only `3^{(d/2)c}`.
