# Transporting the stream `Γ_σ` estimates to the cutoff sample law

The proved stream estimates of `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Stream` are all
stated under the canonical shell-sequence law `M.P.toMeasure` on `ShellSeq d`,
while every consumer downstream of the genuine lower-infinite cutoff works
under `Cutoff.cutoffSampleLaw M` on the lower-tail-good subtype
`Cutoff.CutoffSample d`.  This module supplies the transport between the two.

The bridge is the exact push-forward identity
`Cutoff.map_cutoffSampleLaw_val`: the sample law pushes forward along the
subtype inclusion to the shell law.  Because that inclusion is a measurable
embedding, the induced identity on preimages holds for *every* subset of
`ShellSeq d`, measurable or not, so the transport of a weak-Orlicz tail bound
needs no measurability or admissibility hypothesis at all: an upper-tail event
of `fun omega => X omega.1` is by definition the inclusion preimage of the
corresponding upper-tail event of `X`.

## Main results

* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Stream.measure_preimage_val_cutoffSampleLaw`:
  the inclusion preimage identity for arbitrary subsets.
* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Stream.isBigOWith_cutoffSampleLaw_comp_val`:
  the generic one-sided transfer.
* `Algsuperdiff.Section3.Provider.Stream.isBigOWith_cutoffSampleLaw_of_forall_eq_comp_val`:
  the same transfer for a sample-level function that is only known to factor
  through the inclusion pointwise.
* The `_cutoffLaw` corollaries: each principal proved stream export restated
  verbatim under `Cutoff.cutoffSampleLaw M`, with `omega.1` in place of
  `omega`.

## References

* ABK26 (the transported displays; see the source citations on the proved
  exports themselves).

carrier is a measurable embedding. -/

    MeasurableEmbedding (Subtype.val : CutoffSample d → ShellSeq d) :=
  MeasurableEmbedding.subtype_coe (measurableSet_lowerTailGoodSet d)

/-- Every subset of the shell-sequence carrier -- measurable or not -- pulls
back along the sample inclusion with exactly its original mass.  This is the
measurable-embedding strengthening of `Cutoff.map_cutoffSampleLaw_val`. -/

/-! ## The generic transfers -/

/-- Generic transfer of a one-sided weak-Orlicz tail bound from the canonical
shell law to the cutoff sample law.  No measurability of `X` and no
admissibility of `Ψ` is needed: the upper-tail event of `fun omega => X omega.1`
is definitionally the inclusion preimage of the upper-tail event of `X`, and
the inclusion preserves the mass of every subset. -/
