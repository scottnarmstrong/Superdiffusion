# Provider: the boundary-strip volume fraction

The proof of `l.approximation.stationary.by.local` in ABK26 fixes a cutoff
`η_{K,L}` that equals `1` at distance at least `3^{K-L}` from `∂cu_K`, sets

`Σ_{K,L} := {x ∈ cu_K : η_{K,L}(x) ≠ 1}`,

and records the volume fraction `e.boundary.strip.volume`

`|Σ_{K,L}| ≤^{-L} |cu_K|`.

With the concentric-subcube cutoffs of CoarseGraining
(`Homogenization.QuantitativeCubeCutoff`, which is `1` on `scaledClosedCubeSet
Q ρ` and supported in `scaledOpenCubeSet Q 1`) the set `Σ` is contained in
`cu_K \ scaledClosedCubeSet cu_K ρ` with `ρ = 1 - 3^{-L}`, whose volume
fraction is exactly `1 - ρ^d`.  So the displayed estimate reduces to the
elementary Bernoulli bound `1 - ρ^d ≤ d (1 - ρ)`, with `C = d`.

This file proves that scalar reduction, which is the only part of
`e.boundary.strip.volume` that is independent of the cube-measure A.
