# The finite-corridor iterate mean bound (`e.iter.post.new`)

The single public below is *exactly* the proposition that the proved terminal
theorem

`exists_isCommonEventTwoTermBigOWith_cutoffResponseJ_of_iterateMeanBound`
(`Provider/Homogenization/UnionCompletion.lean`)

takes as its one conditional A obligation `hIter`.  The statement below is a
byte-level transcription of that binder type, so the terminal theorem is
discharged by the bare application

```text
exists_isCommonEventTwoTermBigOWith_cutoffResponseJ_of_iterateMeanBound _
  (exists_iterateMeanBound_integral_cutoffResponseJ _)
```

with no glue at all.  This module is a Provider helper and makes no
source-node status claim by itself.

## What is assembled here, and from what

Three proved publics are consumed and nothing they prove is re-proved.

1. `exists_finiteRecurrence_integral_cutoffResponseJ`
   (`FiniteRecurrence.lean`) supplies the `A.4` recurrence constants
   `(Chom_R, A, C, j_0)` and, at every corridor depth `t` with `j_0 < t` and
   `Chom_R |log epsilon| <= t`, the display
   `F t <= A d_1 (d_1 + 3^{-t}) + C sum_{k=1}^t 3^{-k} (F(t-k) - F t)` for
   `F t := E[J(cu_{L+t}, sigmabar_L^{-1/2} e, sigmabar_L^{1/2} e; a_L)]` and
   `d_1 := 10^9 E^2 gamma`.  Its clause binder is carried at the *observation*
   scale `L + t`, so the proposition's own clause at `m - 1` supplies it
   exactly when `L + t <= m`.
2. `integral_cutoffResponseJ_nonneg_and_le_amplitude` (`IterateInit.lean`)
   supplies the engine's other two slots, `hFnonneg` and `hcrude` at `K_0 = 1`,
   **with no horizon**: `0 <= F t` and `F t <= d_1` for every `t : ℕ`.
3. `finiteCorridor_weightedDefect_iteration` (`FiniteCorridorIteration.lean`)
   is the weighted-mean engine.  The *existential* wrapper
   `exists_finiteCorridor_weightedDefect_decay` (`ibid.:475`) is **not** used:
   its `K` and `rho` are opaque witnesses, and the constant `Citer` produced
   below has to be built from them explicitly.  The fixed-constant public
   gives `finiteCorridorAmplitude A' (1/3) 0` and `rho =
   finiteCorridorDecayRate C` by name; the amplitude actually delivered by
   `exists_shift_engine` is `K = max (finiteCorridorAmplitude A' (1/3) 0) 1`,
   the `max` being what supplies the `1 <= K` that the final arithmetic needs
   (disclosed again at the `exists_shift_engine` entry below).  That is what
   makes `Citer` nameable before the model, the tolerance, the cutoff and the
   direction.

## The construction, and the two audit adjudications it implements

That is exactly what `truncated_shift_decay` below does: with `T:= (m -
L).toNat` it forms `G t:= if t <= T then F t else 0`, feeds `G` the *unbounded*
nonnegativity and crude bound of both branches, and establishes only the
recurrence by cases --- for `t <= T` it is the proved recurrence verbatim (the
clause binder at `L
+ t <= m` follows from the proposition's clause at `m - 1`), and for `t > T` it
degenerates to `0 <= (nonnegative)`.

The certified replacement, followed here, is a consumer-side shift with the
**sharp** geometric prefix `sum_{k > j} r^k <= (3/2) r^{j+1}` at `r = 1/3`,
absorbed into `A' := A + (3/2) r = A + C/2` (`geom_third_Icc_shift_le`,
`shifted_third_recurrence`), after which the engine is run at `j_0 = 0`, where
`finiteCorridorAmplitude A' (1/3) 0 = 2 (A' + 2)` is dimension-only and the
delivered amplitude is `K = max (finiteCorridorAmplitude A' (1/3) 0) 1`.  The
engine's own shift (its private `earlyPrefix_sum_le`, which pays a cardinality
factor `j_0`) is *not* bypassed: it is still invoked inside the engine
(`FiniteCorridorIteration.lean`), at `j_0 = 0`, where its cardinality factor
is `0`, so it is paid at zero cost.  The proved engine is not modified in any
way.

**The two separations.**  With `u := |log epsilon|`,

```text
t_0    := max (j_0 + 1) ceil(Chom_R u)        (the recurrence's own two binders)
j*     := ceil((log(4 * 10^9 * K) + u) * lam^{-1}),   lam := -log rho > 0
k_1    := t_0 + j*  .
```

`j*` is the least depth with `rho^{j*} (4 * 10^9 K) <= epsilon`; it is obtained
by taking logarithms (`Real.log_pow`, `Real.exp_log`) rather than through
`rpow`.  The budget `k_1 <= Citer u` is `shift_budget_le`, whose only analytic
input is `1 <= 2 u`, i.e. `|log epsilon| >= log 2 > 1/2`, which is where
`epsilon <= 1/2` is used.

**The constant.**

```text
Citer := max 1 (max Chom_R (max (4 K 10^18)
           (2 (j_0 + 3) + Chom_R + (2 log(4 * 10^9 K) + 1) lam^{-1}))) .
```

All four branches are dimension-only: they are built from `(Chom_R, A, C, j_0)`
and from `K, rho`, all selected before `M`, `E`, `epsilon`, `L`, `n`, `e`.  The
gate `gamma <= Citer^{-1} E^{-2} epsilon` implies the consumed gate
`gamma <= Chom_R^{-1} E^{-2} epsilon` because `Citer >= Chom_R` (monotone in the
right direction), and that one gate feeds *both* the recurrence and the
initialization, the latter at `Chom := Chom_R >= 10^9`, which is the floor the
amplitude bridge's gate route requires.

**The final arithmetic.**  At any `n` with `L + k_1 <= n <= m`, writing
`t := (n - L).toNat in [k_1, T]` and `j := t - t_0 >= j*`,

```text
F t <= K d_1 (d_1 + rho^j) <= K d_1 (d_1 + rho^{j*})
    <= (1/4) epsilon E^2 gamma + (1/4) epsilon E^2 gamma
     = 2^{-1} epsilon E^2 gamma ,
```

the first quarter from `K d_1^2 <= (1/4) epsilon E^2 gamma`, which needs only
`Citer >= 4 K 10^18`, and the second from the defining property of `j*`
(`final_absorption`).

## `d = 0`

The transcribed proposition quantifies over an arbitrary `d : ℕ`, exactly as
the terminal theorem and the frozen statement do, while both proved inputs
carry `[NeZero d]`.  The degenerate case is discharged from the standing model
itself: `M.shellPrefix.dimension : 2 <= d` is contradictory at `d = 0`, so the
whole inner `forall` is vacuous there and the witness `Citer := 1` serves.  For
`0 < d` the instance `NeZero d` is produced and the construction above runs.
No `[NeZero d]` binder is added to the statement, which is what makes the bare
application to the terminal theorem type-check.

/-- **The consumer-side shift.**  A finite weighted-defect recurrence available
only above a separation `t0`, together with the crude bound at `K₀ = 1` and
nonnegativity, becomes a recurrence for the shifted sequence `j ↦ G (t0 + j)`
available at every `j ≥ 1`, at the enlarged forcing coefficient `A + C/2` and
with the *same* defect coefficient `C`.

The lags that cross the shift are paid for by `geom_third_Icc_shift_le`, so the
enlargement `C/2 = (3/2)₀ r` at `K₀ = 1`, `r = 1/3` does not see `t0`.  That is
the whole point: the engine can then be run at `j₀ = 0`, where its amplitude
`finiteCorridorAmplitude` is independent of the shift. -/

/-- **Zero-truncation plus shift, feeding the proved engine at `j₀ = 0`.**

Truncating `F` to `G t := if t ≤ T then F t else 0` discharges exactly that
one slot: above `T` the recurrence degenerates to `0 ≤ (nonnegative)`, and the
other two slots are unaffected because both branches of the truncation satisfy
them.

The conclusion is stated at the engine's own named constants, so the amplitude
and the rate are available to the caller before any model datum is chosen. -/

/-! ## The iterate mean bound -/

/-- One dimension-only constant `Citer ≥ 1` is selected before the model, the scale,
the tolerance, the cutoff and the direction.  Under the frozen regime binders
`15 c_star^{-1} ≤ E` and `gamma ≤ E^{-10}`, the preceding-error clause at every
scale `k ≤ m - 1`, the printed tolerance range `epsilon ∈ (0, 1/2]` and the
smallness gate `gamma ≤ Citer^{-1} E^{-2} epsilon`, a *single* separation `k₁` of
logarithmic size `k₁ ≤ Citer |log epsilon|` is fixed --- before any cutoff `L` and
any unit direction `e` --- such that

```text
E[J(cu_n, sigmabar_L^{-1/2} e, sigmabar_L^{1/2} e ; a_L)] ≤ (1/2) epsilon E^2 gamma
```

at every cutoff `L ≤ m - 1`, every unit direction and every observation scale
`L + k₁ ≤ n ≤ m`.

This proposition is byte-identical to the `hIter` binder of the proved
`exists_isCommonEventTwoTermBigOWith_cutoffResponseJ_of_iterateMeanBound`
(`UnionCompletion.lean`, its), which it discharges by bare application.

This is a local Provider theorem and makes no source-node status claim. -/
