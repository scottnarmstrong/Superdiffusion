# Provider: the remainder arithmetic of the localization good-event aggregation

After the `σ̄`-switch and the `δ = 1` sensitivity injection, the good-event leg
of `e.mathcal.E.breakdown` carries a *per-cube* additive remainder.  Summing it
over `z ∈ 3^l ℤ^d ∩ □_m` and over the localization weights `c_{2s} 3^{-s(m-l)}`
produces the fifth summand of `e.localization.mathcalE.estimate` --- the
printed

`C γ² (h² + s^{-2} + E⁴ |log γ|⁴)`.

**This module carries exactly that scalar collapse, and nothing else.**  It is
purely deterministic real analysis: no measures, no `Γ`-Orlicz layer, no
coefficient fields, no cubes.  Everything below is a statement about the real
series `Σ_{j ∈ ℕ} 3^{-s j} (…)` at `j = m - l`.

This is a *provider endpoint only*.  It is not a source node, not a frozen
declaration, and it closes no fraction of `l.localization.mathcalE`.

## The corrected per-cube remainder, and two divergences from the print

* The printed per-cube display ends with `C min{γ²Δ², 3^{2γΔ}} +⁴γ²|log γ|⁴` at
  `Δ = m - l + h`.  Since `u² ≤ 3^{2u}` for `u ≥ 0`, that minimum is
  identically `γ²Δ²`, which is strictly stronger than what the quoted input
  (`e.switchtheshoms.betterer.again`, whose right side carries an *uncancelled*
  `3^{γΔ}`, squared by the `e.shaking.lambda` remainder) yields, and it is
  false for large `Δ`.  The corrected per-cube remainder --- the one this
  module sums --- is `C min{γ²Δ², 1} · 3^{2γΔ} +⁴γ²|log γ|⁴ · 3^{2γΔ}`.  It is
  carried here by `switchRemainder`.  Note the manuscript *itself* uses the
  corrected `min` one display later.

* The fifth summand's constant is `C(d, c⋆)`, not a pure `C(d)`.  **That
  divergence does not arise here.**  The `c⋆`-dependence enters through the
  *per-cube* constant of the switch step (the `hpre`-style ellipticity
  witness), i.e. through the caller's `C` in
  `localization_remainder_series_le_of_termwise`; the collapse proved in this
  module multiplies that `C` through unchanged and contributes an **absolute**
  numerical factor `1024`, with no dependence on `d`, on `c⋆`, or on any
  coarse-grained ellipticity witness.  Callers must still record the
  `c⋆`-dependence they bring in.

## Honest arithmetic versus the printed proof

The printed target is `C γ²(h² + s^{-2} + E⁴|log γ|⁴)` and the printed device is

> Since `s ≥ 8γ` and `3^{-sγ^{-1}} ≤ C s^{-2} γ²`, we have
> `c_{2s} Σ_l 3^{-s(m-l)} min{γ²(m-l+h)², 1} 3^{2γ(m-l+h)} ≤ C(h² + s^{-2})γ²`.

**Achieved here: the printed shape, at the absolute constant `1024`, with the
`E`-leg included.**  Precisely, `localization_remainder_series_le` gives

`c_{2s} Σ_{j ≥ 0} 3^{-sj}(min{γ²(j+h)²,1} + E⁴γ²|log γ|⁴) 3^{2γ(j+h)}` ` ≤ 1024
γ² (h² + s^{-2} + E⁴|log γ|⁴)`,

for every `s ∈ [8γ, 1]`, `γ > 0`, `h ∈ ℕ` with `γ h ≤ 1`.  Two deviations from
the printed derivation are recorded, both in the direction of *less* loss:

1. Summed honestly it contributes `c_{2s} · E⁴γ²|log γ|⁴ · 3^{2γh} (1 -
   3^{-(s-2γ)})^{-1} ≤ 27 E⁴γ²|log γ|⁴`, the `27 = 3 × 9` coming from `c_{2s} ≤
   3 c_{s-2γ}` and `3^{2γh} ≤ 9` (`γ h ≤ 1`).  The amplitude carries the
   load-bearing `γ²` and **no** `s` power.

2. **The printed split is not needed.**  The printed proof splits the `min` at
   the index where `γ(j+h) ≥ 1` and absorbs the tail with
   `3^{-sγ^{-1}} ≤ C s^{-2} γ²`.  Reindexing exactly --- absorbing `3^{2γj}`
   into `3^{-sj}` to the *lossless* ratio `q = 3^{-(s-2γ)}`, which is `< 1`
   because `s ≥ 8γ` --- makes the quadratic series converge outright:
   `min{γ²(j+h)²,1} ≤ γ²(j+h)² ≤ 2γ²((j+1)² + h²)` and
   `Σ_j (j+1)² q^j ≤ 2(1-q)^{-3}`.  No case split, no cutoff index, no
   absorption inequality.  The printed device is therefore *sufficient but not
   necessary*, and is **not consumed** by the collapse.  This is
   a presentational observation about the printed proof, not a defect in it.

   The lossy alternative is real: replacing the `min` by the *linear* envelope
   `min{a²,1} ≤ a` (valid for `a ≥ 0`) collapses to `C(γ h + γ s^{-1})`.

   **That claim is false and is withdrawn.**  The frozen unit-M `Γ₂` amplitude
   is `Cms · E · s^{-1} · √(ε γ)`
   (`Algsuperdiff/Frozen/Section3/MultiscaleEstimate.lean`), which squares to
   `Cms² · ε · E² · γ · s^{-2}`; dividing the linear-envelope bound by it
   leaves `Cs · Cev · (h s² + s) ≤ Cms² ε E²`, and the frozen parameter window
   `(Disorder.cstar M)^{-1} · ε^{-Cms} ≤ E` gives `ε E² ≥ ε^{1-2Cms} c⋆^{-2}`,
   unboundedly large as `ε ↓ 0` for `Cms > 1/2`, against `h ≍ Cms |log ε|`.
   So the `γ¹` shape **clears** the budget as well: the `γ`-power heuristic
   silently dropped the `ε`/`E` factors that actually supply the margin.

   The genuine reason the quadratic route is required is **fidelity**: the
   printed fifth summand is `C γ²(h² + s^{-2} + E⁴|log γ|⁴)`, so a `γ¹` result
   would be a *different, weaker statement* than the one this module must
   deliver.  "The quadratic route is what buys the `γ²`" is the correct
   sentence; the budget justification for it is not.

## Where the constants come from

`c_{2s} = 1 - 3^{-2s} ≤ 3 (1 - 3^{-(s-2γ)}) = 3 c_{s-2γ}` (needs `s ≥ 6γ`; the
factorization `1 - q³ = (1-q)(1+q+q²)`), and `c_{s-2γ}^{-1} ≤ 2/(s-2γ) ≤ 3/s`
(needs `s ≥ 6γ` and `s - 2γ ≤ 1`).  One factor of `c_{s-2γ}` then cancels
against the poles, giving

`c_{2s} · Σ ≤ 108 γ² (1-q)^{-2} + 54 γ² h² + 27 E⁴γ²|log γ|⁴` `  ≤ 972 γ²
s^{-2} + 54 γ² h² + 27 E⁴γ²|log γ|⁴`,

and `max{972, 54, 27} ≤ 1024`.  The stated constant `1024` is an absolute
numeral chosen for roundness; the derivation supports `972`.

Only `s ≥ 6γ` is used.  The binder is stated at the source window `8γ ≤ s`
(tex `s ∈ [8γ, 1]`), which is what every caller has.

## Carriers and consumer fit

* The outer weight is spelled `Real.rpow (3 : ℝ) (-s * (j : ℝ))`,
  **byte-for-byte the spelling of `breakdownLegSum`**
  (`Provider/Localization/Breakdown.lean`), whose reindexing convention `j = m
  - l ∈ ℕ`, scale `m - (j: ℤ)`, this module adopts.
* `c_{2s}` is `Book.Ch02.geometricDiscount s 2` (CoarseGraining,
  `Homogenization/Book/Ch02/MultiscaleEllipticity.lean`), the carrier
  `Breakdown.lean` already identifies with the manuscript's `c_{2s}`.  Its
  unfolding is `geometricDiscount_two_eq`.
* The main consumer entry point is
  `localization_remainder_series_le_of_termwise`: it takes an arbitrary
  nonnegative per-scale remainder `f` dominated termwise by
  `C * switchRemainder γ E h j` and returns the collapsed amplitude at `1024 *
  C`. Its `Summable` obligation is discharged internally, so callers owe none.

## Main results

The 8 privates are `rpow_three`, `geometricDiscount_two_le_three_mul_shift`,
`inv_one_sub_shift_le`, `sq_succ_le_two_mul_choose`, `weight_reindex`,
`hasSum_envelope`, `weighted_switchRemainder_le`, `collapse_core`.  The 10
publics, in file order:

* `geometricDiscount_two_eq` --- the `c_{2s} = 1 - 3^{-2s}` normal form.
* `geometricDiscount_two_nonneg`, `geometricDiscount_two_le_four_mul` --- `q =
  2` wrappers of upstream CoarseGraining publics (see the retraction above),
  not new results.
* `switchRemainder`, `switchRemainder_nonneg` --- the corrected per-cube
  remainder envelope.
* An identity, not an estimate.
* `summable_weighted_switchRemainder` --- summability of the weighted family.
* `localization_remainder_series_le` --- the full remainder collapse.

/-- **`c_{s-2γ}^{-1} ≤ 3/s`** at `0 < γ`, `6γ ≤ s ≤ 1`.

The earlier justification for declining it ("`half_le_one_sub_...` is already
in the import closure") was circular: WaveSizes was in the closure *only*
because of this one consumption.

**Sharpness, and why the conclusion is unchanged.**  At `ρ := s - 2γ ≤ 1` the
GridWeights pole is uniformly sharper (`1 + ρ^{-1} ≤ 2/ρ` always, since `ρ^{-1}
- 1 ≥ 0`): it supports `(1-q)^{-1} ≤ (7/3)/s` on this module's window and hence
a headline `588 γ²/s²` in place of `972 γ²/s²`.  The `3/s` conclusion is **kept
deliberately**, so that every public statement of this module — and in
particular the numeral `1024` — is unchanged; the sharper `588` is recorded,
not taken.  Any downstream numeral must still be read off the proved statement.

`shom_continuity` display) and `Δ = (m:ℝ) - (n:ℝ)` at `m n : ℤ`, whereas
`switchRemainder` is **factored**, with `min (·) 1` (the order the tex carries)
and `(j:ℝ) + (h:ℝ)` at `j h : ℕ`.  The two are **equal, not merely comparable**
— no massaging, no loss, no absorbed constant — and the whole glue is
`min_comm` plus one `ring` normalization of the rpow exponent (`2*(γ*Δ)` is not
defeq to `2*γ*Δ` over `ℝ`) plus `push_cast` for the `ℤ → ℝ` reindex at `n:= m
