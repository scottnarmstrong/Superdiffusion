# Provider: the `(J3)` adjoint leg of the localization `J`-injection

ABK26: the `lambda`-gate chain, and the injection display
`e.J.sensitivity.apppp`, read at the **transposed** representative `a^t`.

## What is delivered, and why it is not a rearrangement

The manuscript prints the localization `J`-injection only at the primal
coefficient, while the buckle's deep `J`-sum `T2` needs it at `a^t`.

The transpose statement is not obtained by a deterministic rearrangement of the
primal one.  This is a precise claim and not a claim that no deterministic
transpose-response identity exists: one does, it is proved, it is in this
file's closure, and it is disclosed below
(`responseJ_transpose_neg_right` in
`Section24/Sensitivity/Provider/DhBound/Discharge/AdjointResponse.lean`, `J(U,
a^t, p, -q) = J(U, a, p, q) + 2 p . q`). What that identity cannot do is close
the injection, because it is off-diagonal: at the manuscript's own loadings `p =
shom^{-1/2} v`, `q = shom^{1/2} v` it relates the transposed value at `v` to the
primal value at the loading `(p(v), q(-v))`, which is `(p(w), q(w))` for no `w`
at all -- that would force `w = v` and `w = -v` simultaneously -- while the
primal injection endpoint prices only the diagonal pair. So the deterministic
route is genuinely unavailable and the law-level route is genuinely required.
That route is a symmetry of the law, and exactly the one `(J3)` supplies; it is
the route taken here:

* negating every layer, `j_n |-> -j_n`, transposes the lower-infinite field,
  because each layer is antisymmetric and `a_m = nu Id + k_m` with `k_m` skew:
  this is the proved pointwise identity
  `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff_negateCutoffSample_eq_adjoint`;
* the joint law is negation invariant: this is the proved
  `Cutoff.map_negateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw`, which descends from the
  frozen `M.J3.negation` (`a.j.iso`);
* hence the adjoint site at `omega` is almost surely the primal site at the
  negated sample, and every quantity the primal endpoint prices -- the
  `W-underline^{2,infinity}` gauge, the good local event, the `lambda`
  observable -- is negation invariant, so the price is carried at the SAME
  level.

Nothing here re-derives the sensitivity engine at a negated perturbation field:
the primal endpoint is consumed verbatim and evaluated at the negated sample.

## 1. The `(J3)` invariance layer (section 1 below)

The layer the composition needs, in the order it is built:

* the three exact `L-infinity` shell gauges are negation invariant
  (`unitCubeDerivNorm_negate`, `unitCubeSecondDerivNorm_negate`, and the proved
  `Cutoff.localCubeControl_negate` for the zeroth order), hence so are
  `underlineW2Gauge` and `BadEvents.cubeOscGauge`, hence so is the good event's
  own gauge `incrementOscGauge₂`;
* the cutoff triadic family at the negated sample is a.e. the adjoint family
  (`coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_negateCutoffSample_aeEq`), so
  `lambdaSq` is negation invariant (`lambdaSq_negateCutoffSample`, through the
  proved `CoarseEllipticity.lambdaSq_adjointFamily`);
* therefore the good local event `Q(l,n,z)` is negation invariant almost surely
  (`mem_goodLocalEvent_negateCutoffSample_ae`): its sensitivity clause exactly,
  its ellipticity clause through the measurable representative's own a.e.
  identification `BadEvents.cubeLowerEllipticity_ae_eq_literal`.  The
  representative `cubeLowerEllipticity` is an `A.mk` choice, so this clause is
  genuinely only almost sure -- which is all the consumer needs, since the
  endpoint is itself an almost-sure statement.

## 3. The transposed priced endpoint (section 3 below)

`responseJ_transpose_injection_priced_forall_loads_of_primal` carries the primal
per-`(l,z)` priced injection display to the transposed representative, at the
same loadings `p = shom_{l-h}^{-1/2} v`, `q = shom_{l-h}^{1/2} v`, the same
leading constant `3` and the same remainder

```
324 C_resp (16 Ccg + 8 Ccg^2) cstar^{-1} cgamma 3^{4l - 2 cgamma l}
  ||k_m - k_{l-h}||^2_{W-underline^{2,infinity}(z+cu_l)} ,
```

## The scale gate on `m0`

The landmark premise carried by every statement below is `mStarStar M < m0`,
**not** the printed `m0 in (mstar, infty) cap Z`.  Nothing else moved: the
premise is forwarded verbatim to the proved statements consumed here, no proof
step here consumes it, and no frozen statement changes --
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.diffusivity_asymptotics` keeps the printed `mStar
M < m0` and reaches the weaker-gated chain a fortiori through
`Provider.Scales.mStarStar_le_mStar`.

## Related statements elsewhere

The `c >= 0` amplitude-scaling twins
`Stream.unitCubeDerivNorm_scale_of_nonneg` and
`Stream.unitCubeSecondDerivNorm_scale_of_nonneg` are *not* usable here:
`ShellField.negate = ShellField.scale (-1)`, and the sign hypothesis `0 <= c`
fails at `c = -1`.  The route taken instead is the sharp characterization pair
`Stream.unitCubeDerivNorm_le_iff` / `Stream.unitCubeSecondDerivNorm_le_iff'`
composed with `ShellField.matrixDerivativeNorm_neg`, which is exact.  Its
second-derivative companion `matrixSecondDerivativeNorm_neg` is proved below,
from `ShellField.matrixSecondDerivativeNorm_le_iff` in both directions.

  localization display --- `a_m` and `a_m^t` are equidistributed by `(J3)`,
  hence a priced primal statement transfers to the transpose at the same level
  --- is that same move at a different functional; nothing in the route
  depends on it.

Its sensitivity clause is invariant (`incrementOscGauge₂_negateCutoffSample`);
its ellipticity clause is invariant only almost surely, because
`BadEvents.cubeLowerEllipticity` is an `A.mk` representative of
`lambda_{1/8,2}(z+cu_l; a_n)` and a choice of representative need not commute
with the negation pointwise.  Both readings of the representative are pinned to
the literal observable by the proved
`BadEvents.cubeLowerEllipticity_ae_eq_literal`, and the literal one is
invariant by `lambdaSq_negateCutoffSample`.

This is the file's only genuinely new a.e. ingredient beyond those already
carried; it is stated as an implication, which is the direction the composition
of section 3 consumes. -/
