# The model-free arithmetic layer of `shom_continuity`

This module is the arithmetic support of
`Algsuperdiff/Section3/Provider/Localization/ShomContinuity.lean`.  The split
itself was **pure motion**: every statement and every proof arrived as the text
that stood in `ShomContinuity.lean`, unchanged apart from `private lemma`
becoming `protected theorem`.  Nothing was strengthened, renamed, added or
dropped.

That pass rewrote proof *bodies* only: all twenty-nine `nlinarith` closers were
replaced by explicit `calc` chains, monotonicity lemmas
(`mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_*`, `pow_le_pow_left₀`, `one_le_pow₀`,
`le_mul_of_one_le_right`) and named factored-nonnegativity `have`s discharged
by `linarith only`, and every remaining unqualified `linarith` was given an
explicit hypothesis list.  The twenty-three statements are byte-identical to
the pre-pass text and no declaration was added, renamed or removed; warm
own-file elaboration fell from 10.2 s to 3.6 s (`interpretation` 11.7 s to 2.6
s).

## What is here

Two groups, in the order they stood in the original file.

* **Abstract-real arithmetic** --- eighteen of the twenty-three declarations.
* **The three transcendental estimates** --- the remaining five declarations,
  namely `rpow_three_two_mul_le`, the third estimate
  `pow_four_mul_sqrt_mul_abs_log_le` with its two helpers
  `abs_log_le_sixteenth` and `sqrt_eq_pow_eight`, and `one_le_abs_log`, isolated
  exactly as before so that the nonlinear arithmetic tactics never meet a
  transcendental atom.

No renormalization, probabilistic or geometric object occurs anywhere below; no
`ABKModel`, no `Annealed.sigmaBar`, no scale.  The five model-level private
lemmas of the continuity route (`near_flow_bound`, `near_recurrence_bound`,
`window_binders`, `slack_bounds`, `defect_display`) stayed in
`ShomContinuity.lean` and are not duplicated here.

## References

* ABK26, `l.shom.continuity`; proof, whose envelope computation is the
  arithmetic realized here.

/-! ## Abstract-real arithmetic

Every lemma in this section is over abstract reals; none of them contains a
`Real.rpow`, `Real.exp` or `Real.log` atom, so the arithmetic tactics never meet
a transcendental. -/

/-- **The short-range core of branch (B).**  Two positive reals `a`, `b`
approximating two reals `A`, `B` with the *same* relative accuracy
`delta <= 1/2`, whose targets are ordered `B <= A <= (1 + 4x) B` with
`0 <= x <= 1/8`, have two-sided ratio defect at most `8x + 24 delta`.

This is the arithmetic read off the flow display rather than off the recurrence
display: `delta` is the flow's relative defect and `4x` the geometric growth of
the target profile across the gap. -/

/-! ## The three transcendental estimates

Each is a consequence of `Real.add_one_le_exp` or `Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`;
they are isolated here so that no `nlinarith` ever meets a transcendental.
Since the  elaboration pass this file contains **no `nlinarith` at all**, and
every `linarith` in it is an `only`-form with an explicit hypothesis list, so
no rpow-laden context is preprocessed into products anywhere below.  The only
`nlinarith` on the route is in the consumer `ShomContinuity.lean`, the
`only`-form of `near_recurrence_bound` on three `cstar` facts.  `linarith` in
the consumer does meet `Real.exp`, `Real.log` and `Real.rpow`, but only as
opaque atoms and monomials in them (the earlier unqualified claim, that no
arithmetic tactic there sees them in a nonlinear position, was false as
stated). -/
