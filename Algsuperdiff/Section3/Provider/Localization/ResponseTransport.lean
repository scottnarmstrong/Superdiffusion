# Provider: the response transport of the localization breakdown

`Provider/Localization/Breakdown.lean` produces, for the Section 3 carrier, the
display `e.mathcal.E.breakdown` with its two legs `breakdownLegA` /
`breakdownLegB` sitting at the *arbitrary descendant* `R = z + □_l` of `□_m`.
Its consumption interface `breakdownLegA_le_of_paired_bound` /
`breakdownLegB_le_of_paired_bound` demands a bound on

```
J(z + □_l, σ^{-1/2} v, σ^{1/2} v ; a)      for every v with |v|^2 ≤ 2,
```

written as `Book.Ch02.responseJ (Book.Ch02.cubeDomain R) (a.coeffOn R)` — the
bundled Chapter 2 functional on the **open** cube realisation `openCubeSet R`.

The Section 3 response *observable* `Observable.cutoffResponseJ M l L e` is, on
one probability-one event and simultaneously in every direction
(`Observable.ae_forall_cutoffResponseJ_eq_literal`), the raw functional

```
ResponseJ (cubeSet (originCube d l)) (σ̄_L^{-1/2} e) (σ̄_L^{1/2} e)
  (Cutoff.coefficientCutoff M.nu L ω).toFun
```

on the **half-open** realisation of the **origin** cube only — there is no
translate parameter anywhere in the observable.

This module is the bridge between those two spellings.  It is a proved local
provider: it closes no source node and asserts no estimate.  Every statement
below is an *identity* (or, in the consumption lemmas, a transport of a
hypothesis), so no constant is created or lost anywhere in this file.

## The three components

** Translate transport.**  `responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_originCube_translate`
moves the response at `R` under the sample `ω` to the response at `originCube d
R.scale` under the translated sample `Cutoff.translateCutoffSample
(triadicCubeShift R) ω`.  No *rescaling* is performed here and none is needed:
`breakdownLeg{A,B}` and the observable both live at the same scale `l`.  The
scale normalisation `□_l → □_0` is a separate, already proved identity
(`Provider/Multiscale/JCarrierRescale.responseJ_originCube_dilate`).

*There is no printed transport, and none is claimed.*  Every display in ABK26
carries `z + □_l` identically on both sides of the estimate; the manuscript
never moves a response of this proof onto the origin cube.  Its mathematical
content is the pathwise change of variables the manuscript does perform
elsewhere ("rescale and translate so that `z + □_n` appears in place of `□_0`"),
and it is an *identity for every sample*: the only probabilistic ingredient, J1
stationarity, moves the almost-sure **event** and nothing else, so no constant,
no estimate and no printed step is created, transported or consumed by it.

**(b) The `openCubeSet` / `cubeSet` response identity.**
`responseJ_cubeDomain_eq_ResponseJ_cubeSet` is an **equality**, in both
directions, at every triadic cube: the bundled Chapter 2 response on
`cubeDomain Q` (carrier `openCubeSet Q`) equals the raw `ResponseJ` on the
half-open `cubeSet Q`.  It is CoarseGraining's
`Internal.Ch02.book_responseJ_eq_ResponseJ` composed with CoarseGraining's
`responseJ_cubeSet_eq_openCubeSet_of_triadicCube`
(`CoarseGraining/OriginCubeOpenBridge.lean`), whose proof reduces the two
`AHarmonicFunction` value sets to one another through the two CoarseGraining
functors `AHarmonicFunction.toCubeSetOriginCube` / `toOpenCubeSetOriginCube`
(`PDE/HarmonicCube.lean`, built on `Sobolev/H1/OriginCubeBridge` together with
`Sobolev/PotentialSolenoidalOriginCubeBridge`), and observes that the two
volume averages agree because the boundary faces are Lebesgue-null.  (The
transfer is *not* `Sobolev/PotentialSolenoidalCubeBridge`, which is only an
ambient import of that CoarseGraining module.)  Since a genuine equality is
available, no inequality direction has to be selected and the transport
composes in both directions.

**(c) The coefficient bridge.**
`coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_coeffOn_toCoeffField` holds at **every**
scale `L` and **every** cube `Q`, by `rfl`:

```
((Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily M L ω).coeffOn Q).toCoeffField
  = (Cutoff.coefficientCutoff M.nu L ω).toFun .
```

The family's per-cube `CoeffOn` object carries the *same* pointwise
representative for every cube — only its locally derived upper-ellipticity
witness varies (`Cutoff/CoefficientFamily.lean`, the `coefficientCutoffCoeffOn`
field `toCoeffField := coefficientCutoff M.nu m ω`) — so no cube-dependence and
no a.e. modification enters.  The `Filter.EventuallyEq.rfl` shape of the proved
`Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_coeffOn_aeeq` is a consequence of
this, not a restriction to `L = m`: the family's *scale* argument is a free
parameter, and the observable's `coefficientScale` argument is free as well.
There is therefore no carrier obstruction at `L ≠ m`, and none is claimed to be
bridged: `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff M.nu m ω` and `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff M.nu
L ω` are genuinely *different coefficient fields* for `L ≠ m`, and passing
between them is the manuscript's `l.J.sensitivity` step (
`e.J.sensitivity.apppp`), i.e. mathematics, not a spelling change.

## What is deliberately *not* here

* The comparator change `σ̄_m → σ̄_{l-h}` (`e.shaking.lambda` at `λ = σ̄_m
  σ̄_{l-h}^{-1}`) is the comparator normalization of
  `Localization/SwitchNormalization.lean`.  Every deterministic statement in
  this module leaves the comparator `sigma: Observable.PositiveScalar` free,
  so that the transport itself commits to nothing.  The almost-sure
  statements that mention `Observable.cutoffResponseJ` specialise to `sigma
  = Annealed.sigmaBar M L` because the observable pins its loads to `σ̄_L`.
* The coefficient change `a_m → a_{l-h}` (`e.J.sensitivity.apppp`).
* Any bound whatsoever.  The consumption lemmas take the per-cube bound as a
  *hypothesis of a universally quantified statement*, never as a binder of the
  theorem.

## Main results

* `responseJ_cubeDomain_eq_ResponseJ_cubeSet` — component (b), an equality.
* `coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_coeffOn_toCoeffField` and its adjoint
  twin — component (c), at every scale.
* `responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_originCube_translate` and its adjoint twin —
  component, pathwise, at a free comparator and a free coefficient scale.
* `responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_ResponseJ_originCube_translate` — the same
  transport proved in the observable's own raw `ResponseJ`/`cubeSet` spelling.
* `ae_forall_responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_cutoffResponseJ_translate` — the a.e.
  endpoint: on **one** event, for **every** triadic cube `R`, **every**
  coefficient-cutoff scale `L` and **every** loading `v`, the demanded
  `Book.Ch02.responseJ` at `R` is the observable
  `Observable.cutoffResponseJ M R.scale L v` read at the translated sample.  The
  coefficient scale is *inside* the event, at zero import cost, so one and the
  same event serves the coefficient before and after the `J`-sensitivity step.
  `ae_forall_descendant_responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_cutoffResponseJ_translate` is
  its restriction to `descendantsAtScale (originCube d m) l`.
* `breakdownLegA_le_of_originCube_translate_bound` /
  `breakdownLegB_le_of_originCube_translate_bound` — the
  composition with `Breakdown`'s consumption interface, pathwise and at a free
  comparator.

## A.e. structure

The single null set is the one produced by the **all-`L`** literal
identification
`Observable.ae_forall_coefficientScale_cutoffResponseJ_eq_literal`
(`Section3/Observable/CutoffResponseJ.lean`), intersected over the *countable*
type `TriadicCube d` after each member has been pulled back along the
measure-preserving translation `Cutoff.translateCutoffSample`
(`Cutoff.map_translateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw`, the J1 stationarity
descent).  Using the all-`L` variant rather than its fixed-`L` companion
`Observable.ae_forall_cutoffResponseJ_eq_literal` costs nothing: the two live
in the same module, and the all-`L` one is itself only `ae_all_iff` over the
countable index `ℤ`.  So the coefficient scale is quantified *inside* the event
here as well, and both countable intersections (over cubes and over scales) are
already paid for.  The uncountable direction quantifier stays inside each
fixed-cube, fixed-scale event, where the verified common full-block
representative already placed it.  Every deterministic statement in this module
is universally quantified with no null set at all.

/-! ## The almost-sure endpoint through the Section 3 observable -/

/-- The cutoff-sample law is invariant under a real translation of the shell
field, in the `MeasurePreserving` spelling.

Kept private: it duplicates the proved public
`measurePreserving_translateCutoffSample` of
`Provider/Diffusivity/ApproximateRecurrence/Closure/GammaTenCloserMoments.lean`
verbatim, and is re-derived here only so that this carrier-only module does not
acquire that module's frozen-anchor import closure. -/

    MeasurePreserving (translateCutoffSample (d := d) z)
      (cutoffSampleLaw M).toMeasure (cutoffSampleLaw M).toMeasure :=
  ⟨measurable_translateCutoffSample z, map_translateCutoffSample_cutoffSampleLaw M z⟩

/-- **The unit-D endpoint.**  On *one* probability-one event, simultaneously for
every triadic cube `R`, every coefficient-cutoff scale `L` and every loading
vector `v`, the response demanded by `Breakdown`'s consumption interface at `R`
is the Section 3 observable `Observable.cutoffResponseJ M R.scale L v` read at
the translated sample `translateCutoffSample (triadicCubeShift R) ω`.

The coefficient scale is *inside* the event: the all-`L` identification
`Observable.ae_forall_coefficientScale_cutoffResponseJ_eq_literal` is available at
zero import cost (same module as the fixed-`L` one), so no null set is spent on
`L` beyond the one intersection over the countable index `ℤ` that lemma already
performs.  This is what the `J`-sensitivity step needs, since it moves the
coefficient scale from `m` to `l - h` on the same event.

The loads are the observable's own `σ̄_L`-pair, which is the comparator the
observable pins; the free-comparator form of the transport is the deterministic
`responseJ_cutoffFamily_eq_originCube_translate` above.

The null set is the one of
`Observable.ae_forall_coefficientScale_cutoffResponseJ_eq_literal`, pulled back
along the measure-preserving translation and intersected over the countable type
`TriadicCube d`; the uncountable direction quantifier stays inside each
fixed-cube event. -/

/-- **The primal leg from a bound at the translated origin cube.**  A per-cube
bound on the response at `□_{R.scale}` for the translated sample, uniform over
loading vectors of squared length at most `2`, bounds `breakdownLegA` at `R`.

Pathwise, and at a free comparator `sigma`.  The comparator is left free so
that the caller may choose it, but the instantiation that serves the carrier
endpoint is `sigma := Annealed.sigmaBar M m`: that is the comparator matrix
`Breakdown.cutoffHomogenizationError_sq_ae_le_breakdown` reads its legs at, and
a leg produced at `sigma := σ̄_{l-h}` is simply not the leg that endpoint
accepts.  The comparator normalization is not a re-instantiation of `sigma`: it
acts *pointwise inside* the response (→ 9313 replaces the loads `σ̄_m^{∓1/2} e`
by `σ̄_{l-h}^{∓1/2} e` on the same cube `z + □_l` and the same coefficient
`a_m`, at the price of an additive `σ_{m,*}^{-1}` remainder), so it is
discharged **inside the hypothesis `h`**, with `sigma` still `σ̄_m`.

The per-cube bound is a hypothesis of the statement, not a premise of the module:
nothing here asserts that such a bound holds. -/
