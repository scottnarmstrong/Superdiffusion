# Parameter gates for the diffusivity-flow recurrence integration

This module is deterministic parameter-gate infrastructure.  It performs the
scalar bookkeeping that turns a calibration inequality on a flow constant
`Cflow`, together with the two smallness conditions `Cflow c⋆⁻¹ ≤ E` and
`γ ≤ (E⁻¹)¹⁰`, into the three numerical facts that a Section 3.4 assembly needs
when it substitutes the recurrence parameters

  `Eint = Cshell E² |log γ|²`,  `Fint = Cshell`

into `integrate_approx_recurrence`:

* the `γ`-threshold demanded by that lemma at the substituted parameters;
* the absorption of the reported rate into `Cflow c⋆⁻¹ E √γ |log γ|`;
* the bound `Cflow c⋆⁻¹ E √γ |log γ| ≤ 1/4` on that amplitude.

Every hypothesis below is an explicit input binder.  In particular `hcstar32:
cstar ≤ 3/2`, `hcc: cstar ≤ cstarPlus`, `hCshell: 1 ≤ Cshell` and the
calibration `hcal` are *assumed here*, never derived; no model, probability
space, or analytic producer is referenced.

## The calibration hypothesis

All gates share one input inequality on the flow constant,

  `256 * recurrenceIntegrationConstant² * (Cshell (1 + Cshell + cstarPlus)) ≤ Cflow²`.

It is the squared form of the two separate requirements that the arithmetic
actually has: a cube bound `16 C_int Cshell(1+Cshell+cstarPlus) ≤ Cflow³` for the
threshold and the amplitude, and a square bound
`C_int² Cshell(1+Cshell+cstarPlus) ≤ Cflow²` for the rate.  The squared form
above implies both, so a single input suffices.

/-! ### Elementary consequences of the calibration hypothesis -/

/-- The calibration hypothesis forces `Cflow` to be at least `384`; the
numerical room comes entirely from `recurrenceIntegrationConstant ≥ 256` (in
fact `Cflow ≥ 5792` follows, so `384` is far from tight).  The floor is `384`
rather than `256` because under `c⋆ ≤ 3/2` the regime condition only returns
`cstar⁻¹ ≥ 2/3`, and `(2/3)·384 = 256` is what `regime_E_ge` must deliver. -/

/-! ### The pure-algebra core of the threshold gate -/

/-- **Threshold core, over abstract reals.**  The square root and the logarithm
enter only through the opaque atoms `g` and `L`, so no numeric tactic ever
unfolds `Real.sqrt`, `Real.log`, or `Real.rpow`.

The chain is: absorb the bracket into `(9/4)(c²)⁻¹(1 + K + P)`, trade `γ L²` for
`16 g`, trade `g` for `(E⁵)⁻¹`, and finally spend `Cflow ≤ cE` cubed.  Under
`c ≤ 3/2` the bracket absorption costs `9/4` (since `(9/4)c⁻² ≥ 1`) and the cube
`c³ ≤ (3/2)c²` costs a further `3/2`, so the cube hypothesis carries
`16·(9/4)·(3/2) = 54` rather than `16`. -/

/-- **Gate (i): the `γ`-threshold at the substituted recurrence parameters.**

At `Eint = Cshell E² |log γ|²` and `Fint = Cshell` the smallness condition
demanded by `integrate_approx_recurrence` follows from the calibration
hypothesis together with `Cflow cstar⁻¹ ≤ E` and `γ ≤ (E⁻¹)¹⁰`.  This is where
the tenth inverse power of `E` is spent: `√γ ≤ (E⁻¹)⁵` converts the `E²|log γ|²`
inflation of `Eint` into a decaying factor `E⁻³`. -/

/-- **Gate (iii): the amplitude is at most `1/4`.**

The squeeze that converts the relative-error estimate into a two-sided bound
needs the deviation coefficient below `1/4`.  Here `√γ |log γ| ≤ 4 √(√γ)` and
`√γ ≤ (E⁻¹)⁵` give `√γ|log γ| ≤ (E⁻¹)²/4` once `E ≥ 256`, and one factor `E`
is returned by the regime condition. -/
