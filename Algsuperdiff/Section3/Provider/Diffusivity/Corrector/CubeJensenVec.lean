# Portable: the vector cube-average Jensen inequality at the fourth power

This file contains **generic mathematics only**.  Apart from the sibling
portable module `CubeJensen` -- itself a Mathlib + `Homogenization.*` file, and
a candidate for relocation into CoarseGraining -- it imports nothing but
Mathlib and `Homogenization.*`, mentions no ABK26 object, no model, no cutoff
law, no scale and no anchor.

## What is here

Two facts are needed whenever a volume-normalized `L^4` quantity built from the
*averaged* value of a vector field on a cube has to be compared with the
volume-normalized `L^8` norm of the field itself:

* `sq_vecNormSq_cubeAverageVec_le_cubeAverage_sq_of_memLp` -- the vector Jensen
  inequality at the fourth power, `|u_Q|^4 <= avg |u|^4`, where `|.|` is the
  Euclidean length `vecNormSq^{1/2}` on `Vec d` and `u_Q = cubeAverageVec Q u`;
* `cubeAverage_norm_pow_four_le_cubeLpNorm_eight_pow_four_of_memLp` -- the
  volume-normalized `L^4 <= L^8` bridge, `avg ‖g‖^4 <= (‖g‖_{L^8(Q)})^4`, for a
  field valued in an arbitrary normed group, and its Euclidean specialization
  `cubeAverage_vecNormSq_sq_le_cubeLpNorm_eight_vecNorm_pow_four_of_memLp`.

## Why the vector Jensen is not the coordinate one

CoarseGraining proves the `p = 2` vector statement in **sum** form,
`vecNormSq_cubeAverageVec_le_sum_cubeAverage_sq_of_memLp`:

```
  |u_Q|^2 <= sum_i avg (u_i)^2 .
```

Consumers that then need a *fourth* power must either pay a dimensional factor
`d` (Cauchy-Schwarz on the `d`-term sum, the route the proved
`ellipticityBudget_le` takes) or collapse the sum back into a single cube
average.  The second route is taken here, because the display it feeds --
ABK26's fourth-moment display -- is a numerical bound by a dimension-only
constant, and paying an avoidable factor `d` inside a bound whose right-hand
side is a *fourth root* would make the resulting constant `d^{1/4}`-inflected
for no reason.  The collapse is exact, not an estimate: it is the finite
additivity of the cube average, `cubeAverage_finset_sum_of_integrable`, which
CoarseGraining has only in the two-term form `cubeAverage_add_of_integrableOn`
and which is supplied here by rewriting both sides as integrals against the
normalized cube measure.

With the sum collapsed, `|u_Q|^2 <= avg |u|^2` is a genuine scalar cube average
on the right, and the scalar `p = 2` Jensen inequality of CoarseGraining
applies to it a second time, giving `|u_Q|^4 <= (avg |u|^2)^2 <= avg |u|^4`.

## Main results
