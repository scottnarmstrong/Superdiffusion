# Additive algebra of the distributional harmonicity predicate

`HarmonicWeak` proves that `IsWeaklyHarmonicOn` is stable under restriction to a
subset, under multiplication by a constant, and that constants are weakly
harmonic.  It does **not** prove stability under subtraction, and
that is the one closure property the nested-recentring route of
`OscillationTelescope` cannot do without: the harmonic increment born at scale
`j` is the difference `h_j - h_{j+1}` of two harmonic replacements built at
consecutive scales, and its harmonicity on the finer cube is what feeds the
arbitrary-gap decay.

Subtraction is *not* formal here.  `IsWeaklyHarmonicOn U u` asserts that the
Green pairing `int_U u * (Delta psi)` vanishes; splitting that pairing
requires knowing that each half is separately integrable, which does not follow
from the vanishing of the difference.  The minimal hypothesis that supplies it is
integrability of each summand on `U` alone: the multiplier `Delta psi` is
continuous with compact support, hence bounded, so a merely integrable function
stays integrable after multiplication by it.  In the intended application `u`
and `v` are `H^1(U)` functions on a bounded cube, for which `L^2(U) subset
L^1(U)` gives the hypothesis for free.

## Contents

* `integrableOn_mul_euclideanCoordLaplacian` -- the Green integrand of an
  integrable function against a smooth compactly supported test is integrable.
* `IsWeaklyHarmonicOn.sub` -- closure under subtraction, assuming integrability
  of the two summands on `U`.

## Portability

This file depends only on **Mathlib**, on **CoarseGraining**
(`Homogenization.*`) and on the harmonic layer of this same directory.  It
mentions no object of the manuscript: no model, no cutoff, no shell, no
corrector, no `sigmaBar`.  It is intended to be portable into CoarseGraining by
a single mechanical namespace rename.

The closure property consumed by the nested-recentring telescope: the harmonic
increment `h_j - h_{j+1}` of two harmonic replacements born at consecutive scales
is weakly harmonic on the finer cube, where both are defined. -/
