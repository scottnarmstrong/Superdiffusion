# The arbitrary-gap oscillation decay for a *weakly* harmonic function

`OscillationDecayGap` proves the arbitrary-gap decay
`|| grad u - (grad u)_{z + cu_n} ||_{L2bar} <= C (d) 3^{-k} || grad u - c ||`
for a function `u` that is **smooth** and harmonic on the coarse cube.  The
object the argument downstream actually produces is not smooth: a harmonic
replacement obtained from an `H^1_0` solve is only `H^1`, hence only weakly
harmonic in the sense of `HarmonicWeak`, and `HarmonicWeak` cannot bootstrap its
own regularity.

This module removes that mismatch.  `HarmonicMollifyWeyl` provides the interior
smooth representative of a weakly harmonic function; combined with the proved
decay it yields the same estimate for the smooth representative, on cubes one
triadic scale inside the harmonicity cube.

## What is lost, and why

The mollification consumes one triadic scale: the smooth representative is
produced on `z + cu_{n+k-1}`, not on `z + cu_{n+k}`, because the mollifying
kernel needs room.  Two things follow.

* The gap restriction becomes `k >= d + 3` instead of `k >= d + 2`: the proved
  estimate is applied with gap `k - 1`.
* The right-hand side measures the deviation on `z + cu_{n+k-1}`.  The decay
  factor is still written `3^{-k}`; the single lost scale is absorbed into the
  dimensional constant (it multiplies it by `3`).

The conclusion is stated for the smooth representative `v`, together with
`v = u` almost everywhere on `z + cu_{n+k-1}`.  That is the usable form: all the
quantities in the estimate are integrals of `grad v`, and a consumer holding `u`
in `H^1` identifies `grad v` with the weak gradient of `u` from the
almost-everywhere equality.  Stating the estimate for `euclideanGradient u`
directly would be vacuous, since the pointwise `fderiv` of a merely `H^1`
function carries no information.

## Portability

This file depends only on **Mathlib** and on **CoarseGraining**
(`Homogenization.*`) and on other files of this same harmonic/oscillation
layer.  It mentions no object of the manuscript: no model, no cutoff, no shell,
no corrector.  It is intended to be portable into CoarseGraining by a single
mechanical namespace rename.

## Contents

* `euclideanClosedBall_subset_openCubeAtScale_of_succ` -- the one triadic scale
  of room: a Euclidean ball of radius `3^p` around a point of `z + cu_p` sits
  inside `z + cu_{p+1}`.
* `exists_gradient_oscillation_gap_decay_of_isWeaklyHarmonicOn` -- **the decay
  for a weakly harmonic function**, through its smooth representative.

## References

* ABK26, `e.nablaw.oscillations` (the eventual consumer).
