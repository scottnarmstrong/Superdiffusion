# Portable: cube-average Jensen at the fourth and eighth powers

This file contains **generic mathematics only**.  It imports nothing but
Mathlib and `Homogenization.*`, mentions no ABK26 object, and is a candidate
for relocation into CoarseGraining beside the `p = 2` statements it consumes.

## What is here, and what was already upstream

CoarseGraining already proves the scalar `p = 2` normalized cube-average Jensen
inequality, `Homogenization.sq_cubeAverage_le_cubeAverage_sq_of_memLp`:

```
  (cubeAverage Q f)^2 <= cubeAverage Q (f^2)   for f in L^2(normalizedCubeMeasure Q),
```

together with its coordinatewise vector consequence
`vecNormSq_cubeAverageVec_le_sum_cubeAverage_sq_of_memLp`.  What is *not*
upstream, and is supplied here, is the higher-power form needed whenever a
volume-normalized `L^4` quantity has to be compared with a volume-normalized
`L^8` quantity on the same cube:

* `sq_cubeAverage_pow_four_le_cubeAverage_pow_eight_of_memLp` -- the
  volume-normalized `L^4 <= L^8` comparison, in the form
  `(cubeAverage Q (f^4))^2 <= cubeAverage Q (f^8)`.

It is the same convexity fact, the `p = 2` statement applied to `f^4`.  The
membership bookkeeping (`f` in `L^8` implies `f^4` in `L^2` on the normalized
cube, a finite measure) is done once in the private helper below.

## Note on hypotheses

The statement carries exactly the membership its own proof needs and nothing
more, `MemLp f 8`.  The normalized cube measure is finite, so the weaker
memberships used inside are derived, not assumed.

## Main results

* `sq_cubeAverage_pow_four_le_cubeAverage_pow_eight_of_memLp`
