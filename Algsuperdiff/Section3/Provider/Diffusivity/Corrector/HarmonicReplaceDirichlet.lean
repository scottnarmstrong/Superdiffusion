# The Laplace-Dirichlet solve with divergence-form right-hand side

The harmonic replacement of a function on a cube is obtained by subtracting the
`H^1_0` solution of a Dirichlet problem whose forcing is the *whole* right-hand
side of the equation the function solves.  The only elliptic solve the argument
needs is therefore the one at the **identity coefficient field**:

```
  - Delta phi = div g  in  U ,   phi in H^1_0 (U) ,
```

in the weak form `int_U <grad phi, grad psi> = int_U <g, grad psi>` for every
`psi in H^1_0 (U)`.

CoarseGraining proves the general divergence-form Dirichlet solvability
`exists_isZeroTraceDirichletRhsWeakSolution_of_potentialZeroTraceClosureRealization`
conditionally on `HasPotentialZeroTraceClosureRealization U`, and discharges
that condition on every bounded open convex domain
(`hasPotentialZeroTraceClosureRealization_of_isOpenBoundedConvexDomain`).  This
module composes the two at the scalar coefficient field `1`, where the flux
`matVecMul (scalarMatrix 1) v` is `v` itself, and states the result in the
gradient-pairing form the harmonic replacement consumes.

The `a = 1` case is re-derived here **directly from CoarseGraining**; nothing
from the manuscript-facing `Provider/Corrector/DirichletClosure.lean` (which is
ABK-specific and restricted to triadic cubes) is used, so the domain class is
the general one and the file stays portable.

## Contents

* `isEllipticFieldOn_one` -- the constant identity coefficient field is elliptic
  with `lam = Lam = 1` on every measurable set.
* `exists_h10Function_integral_vecDot_grad_eq` -- **the solve**: on a nonempty
  bounded open convex domain, every `L^2` forcing field admits an `H^1_0`
  potential whose Dirichlet pairing against every `H^1_0` competitor reproduces
  the pairing of the forcing.

## Portability

This file depends only on **Mathlib**, on **CoarseGraining**
(`Homogenization.*`) and on the harmonic layer of this same directory.  It
mentions no object of the manuscript: no model, no cutoff, no shell, no
corrector, no `sigmaBar`.  It is intended to be portable into CoarseGraining by
a single mechanical namespace rename.

## References

* ABK26, `e.nablaw.oscillations` (the eventual consumer).

/-- **The Laplace-Dirichlet solve with divergence-form right-hand side.**

On a nonempty bounded open convex domain `U`, every `L^2` vector field `g`
admits an `H^1_0 (U)` potential `phi` with

```
  int_U <grad phi, grad psi> = int_U <g, grad psi>   for every  psi in H^1_0 (U) .
```

This is CoarseGraining's conditional Dirichlet solvability at the scalar
coefficient field `1`, with the closure-realization hypothesis discharged by
CoarseGraining's bounded open convex realization theorem. -/
