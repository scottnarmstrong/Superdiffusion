# Deterministic scalar arithmetic for the diffusivity flow

This module is deterministic scalar-arithmetic infrastructure for the Section
3.4 diffusivity-propagation assembly.  It contains only inequalities between
real numbers: the two logarithmic decay estimates that convert a `|log γ|`
inflation into a `γ`-power gain, the elementary square-root power comparison,
and the two-sided squeeze produced by a small relative error.

Every hypothesis of every statement below is an explicit input binder chosen
for the arithmetic at hand; none of them is a source premise of a frozen
theorem, and no model, probability space, or analytic producer is referenced.

## Main statements

* `sqrt_mul_sq_abs_log_le`: `√γ |log γ|² ≤ 16` on `(0, 1]`.
* `mul_sq_abs_log_le`: `γ |log γ|² ≤ 16 √γ` on `(0, 1]`.
* `sqrt_mul_abs_log_le`: `√γ |log γ| ≤ 4 √(√γ)` on `(0, 1]`.
* `sqrt_le_inv_pow_five`: `γ ≤ (E⁻¹)¹⁰` gives `√γ ≤ (E⁻¹)⁵`.
* `sq_sandwich_of_relative_error`: `|x − √P| ≤ θ x` with `θ ≤ 1/4` gives `P/2 ≤
  x² ≤ 2P`.

/-! ### The logarithmic decay estimates -/

/-- The elementary bound `|log γ| ≤ 4 (√(√γ))⁻¹` on `(0, 1]`.

It is `log x ≤ x − 1` evaluated at `x = (√(√γ))⁻¹`, together with
`log γ = 4 log (√(√γ))`.  No numeric tactic sees a logarithm. -/

/-- `√γ |log γ|² ≤ 16` for `0 < γ ≤ 1`.

The constant `16` is the honest one: writing `u = √(√γ)` the bound
`|log γ| ≤ 4 u⁻¹` gives `√γ |log γ|² ≤ u² · 16 u⁻² = 16`. -/

`√γ`.  This is the shape consumed by the `γ`-threshold arithmetic, where the

/-- `√γ |log γ| ≤ 4 √(√γ)` for `0 < γ ≤ 1`.

This is the form in which the amplitude `√γ |log γ|` is absorbed: the residual
`√(√γ)` is a quarter power of `γ` and is later traded against `E⁻²`. -/

/-! ### The two-sided squeeze from a small relative error -/

/-- **Squared sandwich from a relative error.**  If `x > 0`, `P > 0`, and `x`
deviates from `√P` by at most `θ x` with `0 ≤ θ ≤ 1/4`, then `x²` and `P` agree
within a factor `2`.

The numerology is exactly `(1 − θ)² ≥ 9/16` and `(1 + θ)² ≤ 25/16 < 2`; both
slack factors `16/9` and `25/16` are below `2`, so the stated constants are
honest with room to spare. -/
