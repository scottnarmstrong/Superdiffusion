# Provider: the corrected recurrence parameters at a free gap multiplier

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.recurrence.params` (label; display) fixes the meso scale `n:= m - h - 16
  ceil|log_3 gamma|` and asserts `m - n <= 8 gamma^{-1}`, "increasing `M =
  M(d)` in `e.cgamma.constraints` if necessary";
* `e.lower.bound.principal.one.pre` (label; display) consumes two `gamma^6`
  remainders, both controlled by `3^{-(m-h-n)/4}`;

## The corrected multiplier, and the arithmetic re-verified here

The printed multiplier `16` is too small: at that choice `3^{-(m-h-n)/4} = 3^{-4
ceil|log_3 gamma|} in (gamma^4/81, gamma^4]` and `gamma^4 <= gamma^6` is false
on `(0,1)`.  The minimal correction replaces `16` by any `a >= 28`; the
development adopts `a = 32`.  This module renders `n` at a **free** multiplier
`a` and proves, at explicit gates, exactly the facts Steps 2 and 3 consume.

1. The quadratic is printed as "`2x - 2ax - a >= 0` in `sqrt x`".  With
   `u := sqrt x`, `x := gamma^{-1}`, the inequality the argument needs is
   `a(2u+1) <= 2u^2`, i.e. **`2u^2 - 2au - a >= 0`**; the printed middle term
   should be `2au`, not `2ax`.
2. The sufficient condition is often read as an equivalence ("i.e.  `sqrt x >=
   a+1`").  It is **sufficient, not necessary**: the positive root of `2u^2 -
   2au - a` is `(a + sqrt(a^2+2a))/2 < a + 1/2`.  Only sufficiency is claimed
   below, and it is what the coverage constant `(a+1)^2` records: `289` at the
   printed `a = 16`, `1089` at the adopted `a = 32`.

Both auxiliary estimates are re-derived here from
`Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos` alone: `ceil(log_3 x) <= 2 sqrt x + 1` (via `log x
<= 2(sqrt x - 1)`, `log 3 >= 1`) and `ceil(log_3 gamma^{-1}) * gamma^{1/4} <=
4` (via `log x <= 4(x^{1/4} - 1)`).

## What is proved

* `logThreeCeil`, `recurrenceGap`, `recurrenceMesoScale` -- the corrected buffer
  `n := m - h - a * ceil|log_3 gamma|` as a function of a free `a : Nat`.
* `rpow_three_neg_recurrenceGap_div_four_le_rpow` and its `a >= 28` instance --
  the Step-3 gate `3^{-(m-h-n)/4} <= gamma^{a/4} <= gamma^7`.
* `recurrenceGap_le_two_mul_inv`, `recurrenceMesoScale_budget` -- the coverage
  condition `gamma^{-1} >= (a+1)^2`'s budget, in `c_star`-free form: the
  constant `c_star` is carried into the conclusion `(6 c_star + 2) gamma^{-1}`
  rather than capped; see the recorded delta below.
* `natCast_le_recurrenceGap_of_rpow_le`, `dim_add_three_le_recurrenceGap` -- the
  `d + 3 <= m - h - n` check, at the explicit gate `3^{d+3} <= gamma^{-1}`.

## Divergences from the printed statement

* **The corrected multiplier is encoded explicitly.**  Nothing below is
  stated at the printed multiplier `16`.  Every statement carries `a` as a free
  natural number and every use of `a >= 28` is an explicit hypothesis.
* **The `c_star <= 1` step is refused; the constant moves instead.**  The
  printed argument passes from `h <= 6 c_star gamma^{-1}` to
  `h <= 6 gamma^{-1}` silently, i.e. it uses `c_star <= 1`.  That bound is
  underivable here by the second-moment route, and the only proved cap is
  `Provider.Disorder.cstar_le_three_halves`, `c_star <= 3/2`.  No declaration in
  this module carries a `c_star <= 1` hypothesis.  Instead
  `recurrenceMesoScale_budget` keeps `c_star` in the conclusion, at
  `(6 c_star + 2) gamma^{-1}` and with no cap assumed, so a caller holding the
  proved cap reads off `11 gamma^{-1}` where the printed argument reads
  `8 gamma^{-1}`.
* **`d + 3`, not `d + 2`.**  The stage numeric is often quoted as
  `d + 2 <= (a ceil|log_3 gamma|).toNat`.  The statement below is proved for an
  arbitrary `N` and instantiated at `d + 3`, which is what the localization
  argument needs; the `d + 2` form is the same lemma at a smaller `N`.

## What is not proved here

* **The `gamma`-threshold bridge is open.**  Nothing here derives `hcover` or
  `hgate` from `e.cgamma.constraints`.  Both thresholds are stated as binders
  precisely so that the missing bridge stays visible at every instantiation
  site; closing it is not attempted in this module.
* **`c_star <= 1` is NOT available**, so the printed budget constant `8` is not
  reachable by this route; the proved cap `c_star <= 3/2` gives `11`.
