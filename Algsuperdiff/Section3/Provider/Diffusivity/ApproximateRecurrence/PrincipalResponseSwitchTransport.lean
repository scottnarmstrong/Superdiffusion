# Provider: the gauge switch of ABK26 Step 3, transported to `z + cu_n`

Source displays in ABK26:

* `l.approximate.recurrence.formula` (label), Step 3;
* the gauge-switch chain of Step 3, whose closing line is sub-step (i) of
  `e.lower.bound.principal.one.pre` (label);
* `l.J.sensitivity` (label), applied at `delta := (1/2) 3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)}`;
* `e.J.by.means.of.bfA` (label);
* `e.good.local.events` (label; display).

## What this module supplies

`ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseSensitivitySwitch` proves the chain at
the **unit cube** `square_0`, because that is the carrier of the frozen
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section24.responseJ_sensitivity`.  Its own module
docstring names two gaps.  This module closes the first of them: the transport
of that chain to the manuscript's localization cube `z + cu_n`.

The transport is an *equality* transport -- no constant is created or lost --
and it is assembled from the same two CoarseGraining interfaces that
`Provider.BadEvents.LambdaCovariance` and `Provider.Multiscale.JCarrierRescale`
already use for `lambda_{s,q}` and for `J`:

* **dilation**: `Ch02.coarseBlockMatrix_dilate` at
  `dilateCube (-m) (originCube d m) = originCube d 0`;
* **translation**: the proved one-cube covariance
  `Provider.BadEvents.coarseBlockMatrix_cutoff_translateCutoffSample`, read
  through `Ch02.coarseBlockMatrix_eq_ofAEEq` so that the carrier is the
  repository's own `Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily`.

The resulting identity `coarseBlockMatrix_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` is the exact
analogue, for the doubled coarse block matrix `bfA`, of the proved
`unitCubeLambda_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` (for `lambda`) and
`responseJ_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` (for `J`).

The second gap it names -- absorption of the Young remainder using the size of
the centered shell and of `lambda_{3/8,2}` on the good event -- is performed in
the second half of this module, and the result is stated cube by cube, with the
good event carried as a **per-cube family**.

Nothing here asserts that the principal-response step of
`l.approximate.recurrence.formula`, its sub-step (i), or `e.lower.bound.principal.one.pre`
is closed: the composed statement is one sub-step of those displays and is itself
conditional on the two binders described under "Binders the caller must supply" below.

## The `3/2`, and why the printed `1 + 3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)}` is optimistic

ABK26 prints the switch factor `1 + 3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)}`, i.e. `1 + 2 delta` at
the manuscript's own `delta = (1/2) 3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)}`.  Obtaining it needs `C
|grad h| lambda^{-1} <= delta`.  What the event `e.good.local.events` supplies
is its *second* inequality,

```
C_sens sup_{L >= n} 3^{2m} ||grad(k_L - k_n)||   <=   3^{-(1/4)(n-m)_+} lambda_{1/8,2} ,
```

i.e. `C |grad h| lambda^{-1} <= Delta = 2 delta`, because the factor `1/2` of
the display sits in the *middle* term (against `shom_{n-1}`) and not in the
`lambda` bound.  The honest switch factor is therefore `1 + delta + Delta = 1 +
(3/2) Delta`, which is what is carried below.  The discrepancy is a constant
factor `3/2` in a quantity the manuscript immediately relaxes to `cgamma^6`; it
is absorbed as soon as `gamma <= 2/3`, by
`three_halves_mul_rpow_three_neg_recurrenceGap_div_four_le_gamma_pow_six`.
This is recorded as an observation about a printed constant, not as a defect of
the argument.

## Binders the caller must supply

Two quantitative inputs are **not** proved here and are disclosed binders on
every statement that needs them.

* `hgrad` -- the discounted gradient gate `C |grad h| <= Delta
  lambda_{3/8,2}(z+cu_n; a_{m-h})` for the **centered** shell `h -
  (h)_{z+cu_n}`.  For the *literal* increment `k_m - k_{m-h}` it is proved:
  `responseSensitivityConst_mul_gradientW1Infinity_le_of_mem_goodLocalEvent_ae`
  derives it, almost surely, from membership in
  `Provider.BadEvents.goodLocalEvent` together with the proved lambda-transfer
  `Provider.BadEvents.lambda_transfer_ae`, given the caller's comparison of the
  centered field's gradient gauge with the literal one.  Centering by a
  constant does not change a gradient, but the two carriers are distinct
  objects in this repository and that identification is not available here.
* `hshell` -- the centered-shell size `||h - (h)_{z+cu_n}||^2 <= Delta^2
  shom_{m-h} lambda_{3/8,2}`.  ABK26 obtains it from the *middle* term of
  `e.good.local.events` (the `shom_{n-1}` bound) together with a Poincare
  estimate on `z + cu_n` for the centered field and `e.cg.ellip.lower` (label).
  This repository has no Poincare centering estimate on a triadic cube, so
  `hshell` stays an explicit hypothesis; it is never assumed in any other form
  and never derived from an unproved lemma.

Neither binder is a predecessor's conclusion and neither smuggles a proof step:
both are quantitative statements about the *data* (the shell increment and the
coarse ellipticity), exactly as uses them.

## Per-cube good events

No union over the grid is formed anywhere in this module.

## Carriers and readings

* The localization cube is a free `TriadicCube d`; `n = m - h - 16 ceil|log_3
  gamma|` of `e.recurrence.params` (label) is never hard-coded.
* The scale gap `G = m - h - n` is never fixed to a numeral.  It enters as
  `scaleGapPos R.scale lowScale` in
  `responseSensitivityConst_mul_gradientW1Infinity_le_of_mem_goodLocalEvent_ae`,
  and as the free `recurrenceGap a gamma` of
  `three_halves_mul_rpow_three_neg_recurrenceGap_div_four_le_gamma_pow_six`.
* Nothing about that reading is restated here: the transported statement simply
  carries `Ch02.lambdaSq Q (3/8) 2` where the unit-cube statement carries
  `unitCubeLambda (3/8) 2`.
* `cstar` does not occur in this module.

/-- **Scale normalization of `bfA`.**  The doubled coarse block matrix of a triadic
family on the centered scale-`m` cube is that of its `3^{-m}`-dilation on the
unit cube.  This is the `bfA` analogue of the proved
`lambdaSq_originCube_dilate` and `responseJ_originCube_dilate`.

/-- The half-open realization of a triadic cube `Q = z + square_m` is the
translate, by the real base point `z = triadicCubeShift Q`, of the centered
cube of the same scale.  This is the `cubeSet` counterpart of CoarseGraining's

negative) scale.

/-! ## Translation covariance at the repository's own family carrier -/

/-- One-cube translation covariance of the doubled coarse block matrix for the
actual coefficient cutoff, stated at
`Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily`: if the half-open realization of
`T` is the translate by `v` of that of `R`, then `bfA(T; a_m)` equals
`bfA(R; a_m)` for the translated sample.

This is the proved
`Provider.BadEvents.coarseBlockMatrix_cutoff_translateCutoffSample` read
through `Ch02.coarseBlockMatrix_eq_ofAEEq`; the two coefficient objects have the
*same* coefficient field and differ only in their ellipticity witnesses.

source-facing frozen declaration. -/

/-! ## The transport -/

/-- **The `bfA` carrier transport.**  The frozen unit-cube doubled coarse block
matrix of the rescaled coefficient object is the doubled coarse block matrix of
the cutoff on the cube `Q = z + square_m` itself:

```
bfA(square_0 ; a_n(z + 3^m .))  =  bfA(z + square_m ; a_n) .
```

`unitCubeLambda_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff` and
`responseJ_unitRescaledCutoffCoeff`.

/-! ## The gauge-switch chain at `z + cu_n` -/

/-- **ABK26 at the manuscript's own cube `Q = z + cu_n`**, at a free sensitivity
parameter `delta` in `(0,1]`.

Every carrier is the localization cube: both doubled coarse block matrices are
`bfA(z + cu_n; .)`, and the ellipticity gauge is the manuscript's own
`lambda_{3/8,2}(z + cu_n; a_{lowScale})`.  The dimension-only constant
`responseSensitivityConst d` is unchanged by the transport, which is a chain of
equalities.

The manuscript's `a_m` is the cutoff at `highScale` and its `a_{m-h}` is the
cutoff at `lowScale`; the load `X` is `P_z` and the constant antisymmetric
matrix `hbar` is `(h)_{z+cu_n}` (built and proved skew in
`ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseShellAverage`).  The two `2 X_1 . X_2`
terms are the manuscript's `2 p_z . q_z` with the sign correction recorded in
`ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseSensitivityAlgebra`; they are kept
explicit rather than absorbed.  The Young remainder is likewise not absorbed at
this stage; the absorption is
`blockVecDot_coarseBlockMatrix_le_switch_absorbed_cube` below.

: this statement holds only under the propositions supplied by its binders --
`dimension` (the paper-wide `2 <= d`), `hskew` (antisymmetry of the averaged
shell), `hshift` (the manuscript's own field decomposition `a_{lowScale} +
hfield = a_{highScale} - hbar` at the rescaled unit-cube carrier), `hgate`
(`e.J.sensitivity.smallness.condition`, label, for the *centered* perturbation)
and the range `hdelta`, `hdelta1` of `delta`.  It is a provider A, not a

/-- **The absorption, as a real inequality.**

Reading the variables at the Step 3 carrier: `E` is `P_z . bfA_m(z+cu_n) P_z`,
`B` is `G_{-(h)} P_z . bfA_{m-h}(z+cu_n) G_{-(h)} P_z`, `t` is `p_z . q_z`,
`nrm1` and `nrm2` are `|p_z|^2` and `|q_z|^2`, `C` is the frozen dimension-only
sensitivity constant, `g` and `w` are the gradient and value gauges of the
centered shell, `lam` is `lambda_{3/8,2}(z+cu_n; a_{m-h})`, `S` is
`shom_{m-h}`, and `Delta` is `3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)_+}`.  `hchain` is the conclusion
of the transported gauge switch at the manuscript's own `delta = (1/2) Delta`.

The three moves are the manuscript's: the two `2 p_z . q_z` pairings cancel down
to `2 (delta + C g lam^{-1}) (p_z . q_z)`; the pairing is folded into the load
by Young at the weight `S`; and the two remainder terms are folded in using
`hgrad` and `hshell`.

/-! ## The discounted gradient gate, from the good event -/

/-- **The discounted gradient gate of `e.good.local.events`, transferred to the
frozen `lambda_{3/8,2}`.**

On the event `cQ(n, m-h, z)` -- here `goodLocalEvent M Ccg R lowScale` at the
localization cube `R` of scale `n` and the coarse scale `lowScale = m-h` -- the
manuscript's second inequality reads

```
C_sens 3^{2n} ||grad (k_L - k_{m-h})||_{W^{1,infinity}(z+cu_n)}
  <= 3^{-(1/4)(m-h-n)_+} lambda_{1/8,2}(z+cu_n ; a_{m-h}) ,
```

and the proved lambda-transfer replaces `lambda_{1/8,2}` by the frozen
`lambda_{3/8,2}(z+cu_n; a_{m-h})`.  The hypothesis `hcentered` is the only
remaining input: it compares the gradient gauge of the caller's centered field
with that of the literal rescaled increment.

`hL` (`m-h <= m`), membership in the good event, and `hcentered`.  It is a
provider A, not a source-facing frozen declaration. -/
