# A **cell-uniform** envelope for the realized upper ellipticity constant

ABK26, Step 2 of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`, `e.CG.bounds.2`.

## The gap this module fills

```
  Lam_R(omega) = Cutoff.coefficientCutoffCubeEllipticityUpper M m omega R
```

at a **fixed** cube `R`, but its majorant carries the local control
`cutoffLocalControl (cubeOriginCoverScale R) m omega`, whose scale is the
canonical origin cover of `R` and therefore moves with `R`.  A grid estimate
over a mesh of cells needs one envelope valid at **every** cell of the mesh at
once.

That envelope is supplied here.  It is *not* a transport: `Lam_R` depends on the
cell only through the integer `cubeOriginCoverScale R`, so there is nothing to
translate --- the mesh-uniform reading is obtained by **monotonicity in the
cover scale**, which is the honest cost of the crude elliptic bound and is
recorded as such below.

## What is proved

* `localCubeControl_mono`, `cutoffLocalControl_mono` --- the deterministic local
  control and its lower-tail series are monotone in the cube scale: a larger
  origin cube can only have a larger sup.
* `cubeOriginCoverScale_mono` --- the canonical origin cover is monotone under
  inclusion of open cubes.  This is minimality of `Nat.find`, not geometry.
* `stripEllipticityEnvelope` --- `Kmaj (1 + u_{cover Q})^2` at the cover scale
  of the **enclosing** cube `Q`, and
  `coefficientCutoffCubeEllipticityUpper_le_stripEllipticityEnvelope`, the
  envelope property at every cube `R` with `openCubeSet R subset openCubeSet Q`.
* `stripEllipticityWeight` --- the combination `Lam + 2 nu^{-1} Lam^2` in which
  the Step-2 majorant reads the ellipticity constant, at the envelope;
  `ellipticityUpper_weight_le_stripEllipticityWeight` is its envelope property.
* `integrable_sq_stripEllipticityWeight` and `stripLambdaMoment` --- the
  **second moment of the weight**, i.e. the fourth moment of the envelope, as a
  finite explicit number.  Its finiteness is the binomial expansion of
  `(1+u)^{2k}` against `Cutoff.P4UpperMoments.integrable_one_add_cutoffLocalControl_pow`.

## The scale of the envelope, stated plainly

`stripLambdaMoment M m Q` is a number attached to the **enclosing cube** `Q`.
When `Q = cu_{Kc}` is the localization cube, that number depends on `Kc`: the
local control at scale `cubeOriginCoverScale (originCube d Kc)` is a supremum of
the shell field over a cube of side `~3^{Kc}`, and the lower-tail law makes its
moments grow with the scale.  No claim of `Kc`-independence is made anywhere
below, and none is used.

## Binders

`stripEllipticityEnvelope`'s envelope property is conditional on the single
geometric containment `openCubeSet R subset openCubeSet Q` and on nothing else:
no smallness, no measurability, no moment and no model gate occurs.  The moment
statements are unconditional.

## Scope

Internal Provider infrastructure for the Step-2 fluctuation estimate.  There is
no `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom axiom and no `set_option maxHeartbeats`.
