# Step 6 of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`: the deterministic fold

Step 6 combines three inputs into the two printed one-sided estimates of
`e.what.do.we.have`:

* the basic split and its localization remainder (`e.lower.bound.basic.split`,
  `e.lower.bound.localization.terms`), contributing an additive `cgamma^10`;
* the principal comparison `e.lower.bound.principal.one`, which supplies the
  multiplicative switch factor `1 +^2 |log cgamma|^2 cgamma` and an additive
  `cgamma^6`;
* the two gauge estimates `e.lower.bound.pre1` and `e.lower.bound.pre2`.

Once those are in hand the passage to the printed displays is *pure real
arithmetic*: one distributes the switch factor over the gauge bound and folds
the products back into the printed error terms.  This module proves exactly that
arithmetic, over abstract reals, with no model, no measure and no carrier.

## The two folds

* `ratio_le_of_switch_upper` --- the `e = 0` branch.  From
  `ratio <= (1 + delta) * gauge + rem` and `gauge <= 1 + A` one gets
  `ratio <= 1 + A + ((1 + Acap) * delta + rem)`, the printed upper display with
  its flat error.  The cap `Acap` on the shell increment is what makes the
  cross term `delta * A` foldable into a flat error; it is supplied at the
  carriers by `Closure.ShellIncrementCap`.
* `ratio_le_of_switch_lower` --- the `e' = 0` branch.  From `ratio <= (1 +
  delta) * gauge + rem` and `gauge <= 1 - A + cross + osc` one gets `ratio <= 1
  - A + 2 * cross + (2 * osc + delta + rem)`.  Here the sign of the drift is
  what does the work: `-delta * A <= 0`, so the cross term is dropped rather
  than capped, and no bound on `A` is needed on this side.

/-! ## The upper fold -/

/-- **Step 6, the `e = 0` branch, as real arithmetic.**

`ratio` is `shom_m shom_{m-h}^{-1}`; `delta` is the switch excess `C E^2 |log
cgamma|^2 cgamma` of `e.lower.bound.principal.one`; `rem` collects the additive
remainders `cgamma^6 + cgamma^10`; `gauge` is the left-hand side of
`e.lower.bound.pre1`; and `A` is the signed shell increment `(log 3) cstar
shom_{m-h}^{-2} sum_{k=m-h+1}^m 3^{2 cgamma k}`.

The conclusion is the printed upper display with the flat error
`(1 + Acap) * delta + rem`. -/

/-! ## The lower fold -/

/-- **Step 6, the `e' = 0` branch, as real arithmetic.**

`ratio` is `shom_{m-h} shom_m^{-1}`; `gauge` is the left-hand side of
`e.lower.bound.pre2`; `A` is the same signed shell increment as above, now
entering with a minus sign; `cross` is the quadratic `h`-error
`C h^2 shom_{m-h}^{-4} 3^{4 cgamma m}`; `osc` is the `cgamma^15` oscillation
remainder of `e.lower.bound.oscillations`.

The hypotheses `0 <= A`, `0 <= cross`, `0 <= osc` and `delta <= 1` are the
manuscript's own standing facts (`A` is a limit of expected energies, `cross`
and `osc` are norms, and `delta` is small by `e.cgamma.constraints`). -/
