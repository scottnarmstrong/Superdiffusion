# The pathwise envelope of a monotone family with a uniform fourth moment

ABK26, Step 2 of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`.

## The obstruction this module removes

`LocalizationFluctuationPerCube.perCube_localizationFluctuation_le` consumes the
Besov envelope of `bfF_z` in the **pathwise** form

```
  hpos1 hpos2 :  forall N, [ gauged bfF_z ]_{B^s_{2,2}, <= N}  <=  Bg
```

--- a single real `Bg`, valid at *every* depth cutoff, at the sample point where
the per-cube bound is being read.  The oscillation input of Step 2 is
**annealed** instead: the pathwise fold cannot be instantiated at the
recurrence's own data, and what is available is a depth fold in the mean,

```
  E[ [ u ]_{<= N}^4 ]  <=  4 (A 3^{-B})^4      (uniformly in N).
```

The two are reconciled here.  The finite-depth positive `q = 2` seminorms are
**monotone in the depth cutoff** (their square is a sum of nonnegative terms over
`range (N+1)`), so the fourth powers form a monotone family; monotone convergence
turns a bound on `E[u_N^4]` that is uniform in `N` into the *same* bound on the
fourth moment of the pointwise envelope, and in particular the envelope is finite
almost surely.  That envelope is the pathwise `Bg` the per-cube bound asks for,
and its fourth moment is the oscillation leg the annealed Hoelder fold consumes.

## What is proved

* `envelopeSup` --- the pointwise envelope: the supremum of the *fourth
  powers*, taken (so that it is total and measurable with no boundedness
  hypothesis) and read back in `ℝ` through the fourth root.  Taking the
  supremum after the fourth power avoids any commutation of `iSup` with `^ 4`.
* `envelopeSup_nonneg`, `le_envelopeSup_of_ne_top`, `pow_envelopeSup` --- the
  three elementary facts.
* `measurable_envelopeSup` --- measurability.

The device built on them is
`Closure.GammaTenEnvelopeInputGrid.exists_grid_pathwise_envelope_of_monotone`:
a monotone, measurable, nonnegative family whose fourth moments are bounded by
a single `C` uniformly in the depth cutoff admits a measurable pathwise
envelope `B` with

```
  (a.e. w)  forall N, u N w <= B w ,        0 <= B ,        E[B^4] <= C ,
```

run simultaneously at every cell of the mesh.  The almost-everywhere quantifier
is the exact strength the consumer needs: the per-cube bound is read inside a
Bochner integral, where `integral_mono_ae` applies.

## Binders

Nonnegativity of the family, and finiteness of the supremum of its fourth
powers wherever a member is to be dominated.  No smallness gate, no geometry,
nothing about the corrector or the coefficient field.

## Scope

There is no `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom axiom and no `set_option
maxHeartbeats`.
