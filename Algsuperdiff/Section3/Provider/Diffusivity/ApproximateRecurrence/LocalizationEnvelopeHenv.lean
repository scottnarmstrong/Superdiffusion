# Provider: the annealed `L^4` envelope, derived from the `L^8` leg

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.nablaw.in.L.eight` (label; display);
* `e.lower.bound.oscillations` (label; display), whose deduction is "by
  `e.nablaw.in.L.eight` and `e.W.1.inf.bound`".

## What `henv` is, exactly

The covering step of `LocalizationEnvelopeMesh` consumes

```
  henv :  int_Omega fint_{cu_K} |grad w|^4  <=  E .
```

This is **not** the manuscript's `L^8` leg.  It is the remaining *annealed*
`L^4` consequence that still has to be derived **from** that leg.  The leg
itself, `e.nablaw.in.L.eight`, is a *pathwise* statement about the *eighth*
normalized norm:

```
  ‖grad w_D‖^2_{L8bar(cu_K)} + ‖grad w_N‖^2_{L8bar(cu_K)}  <=  Chead + Tfluct(omega) ,
```

with `Tfluct` an `O_{Gamma_1}(cgamma^100)` random variable.  Three steps
separate the two; this module performs the first and names the constant the
third produces:

1. **The leg split.**  Both summands are nonnegative, so each of the two
   correctors separately obeys `‖grad w‖^2_{L8bar(cu_K)} <= Chead + Tfluct`.
   Discarding one summand needs the *other* problem to be solvable, which is
   exactly what `Corrector.FreshShellExistence` supplies; no measurable
   selection is involved, because the discarded solution is used only to
   instantiate a universally quantified inequality at one fixed sample point.
2. **The spatial step**, `LocalizationEnvelopeSpatial`:
   `fint_{cu_K} |grad w|^4 <= ‖grad w‖^4_{L8bar(cu_K)} <= (Chead + Tfluct)^2`.
3. **The probabilistic step**, `LocalizationEnvelopeMoment`:
   `E[(Chead + Tfluct)^2] <= 2 Chead^2 + 2 E[Tfluct^2] <= 2 Chead^2 + 32 e^2 A^2`
   at `A = cgamma^100`.

## The envelope constant

```
  freshShellFourthEnergyConst Chead A  =  2 Chead^2 + 32 e^2 A^2 ,
```

and each factor is traceable:

* `2 Chead^2 + 2 E[Tfluct^2]` is `(a+b)^2 <= 2a^2 + 2b^2`, the sharp elementary
  constant;
* `E[Tfluct^2] <= (4 e A)^2 = 16 e^2 A^2` is CoarseGraining's
  `integral_rpow_le_of_isBigOWith_gammaSigma` at `sigma = 1`, `p = 2`, whose
  constant is `gammaMomentConst 1 * 2 = 2 e * 2 = 4 e` (module
  `LocalizationEnvelopeMoment`);
* `2 * 16 e^2 A^2 = 32 e^2 A^2`.

`Chead` is the head constant of `e.nablaw.in.L.eight` and `A = cgamma^100` is
its printed fluctuation amplitude; neither is re-derived here.

## What is proved

* `freshShellFourthEnergyConst` -- the explicit envelope constant.
* `exists_freshShell_cubeEuclideanL8_leg_bound` -- the leg split of
  `e.nablaw.in.L.eight`: each corrector separately, with the same `Chead`,
  the same threshold and the same `Tfluct`.

The derivation of `henv` itself from that leg, and its instantiation at the
actual correctors of `e.def.w` with no envelope binder left, are
`LocalizationEnvelopeWire.gridFourthMoment_mesoWindowEnergy_le_of_measurable_fourthEnergy`
and
`LocalizationEnvelopeWire.exists_freshShell_gridFourthMoment_mesoWindowEnergy_le_wired`,
which need the covering discharge as well and so are the natural place for it.

## What is not proved here

* **Measurability of `Tfluct` in the sample is open.**
  `Corrector.FreshShellL8` produces `Tfluct` existentially and asserts nothing
  about its measurability; `IndependentSums.IsBigOWith` is a statement about
  `mu.real` of upper-tail sets and does not imply it.  Any annealed derivation
  from the leg therefore has to carry that measurability explicitly, as an
  antecedent *inside* the existential that produces `Tfluct`, which is the
  narrowest honest placement.
* **Measurability of the correctors in the sample is open.**  The leg split
  below assumes nothing of the kind: it is quantified over one sample point and
  one pair of solutions at a time, with no sample-space hypothesis at all.
* **`L^8` membership of the gradient is a binder.**  A finite
  `cubeEuclideanLpNorm` does not give it (see `LocalizationEnvelopeSpatial`).
* **The second inequality, `<= cgamma^{15}`, is untouched.**

`Corrector.exists_cubeEuclideanL8_gradient_sq_sum_le_const_add_gammaPow` bounds
the *sum* of the two squared normalized `L^8` gradient norms.  Since both
summands are nonnegative, each corrector separately obeys the same bound; the
only thing needed to discard the other summand is that the other problem is
solvable at the same sample point, which
`Corrector.exists_isMeanZeroNeumannRhsWeakSolution_streamForcing` and
`Corrector.exists_isZeroTraceDirichletRhsWeakSolution_streamForcing` supply
unconditionally.  `Chead`, the threshold `gamma0`, `Tfluct` and its tail are
unchanged. -/
