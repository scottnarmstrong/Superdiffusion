# Provider: the centered-shell size `hshell`, reduced to the centering estimate

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.good.local.events` (label; display), whose chain is `C_sens sup_{L>=n}
  3^{2m} ||grad(k_L-k_n)||_{W^{1,infinity}(z+cu_m)} <= (1/2)
  C_{e.cg.ellip.lower}^{-1} 3^{-(1/2)(n-m)_+} shom_{n-1} <= 3^{-(1/4)(n-m)_+}
  lambda_{1/8,2}(z+cu_m; a_n)`;
* `e.cg.ellip.lower` (label), the source of the constant `C_{e.cg.ellip.lower}`
  carried here as the explicit parameter `Ccg`;
* the Young remainder of Step 3, whose absorption needs `||h - (h)_{z+cu_n}||^2
  <= Delta^2 shom_{m-h} lambda_{3/8,2}`.

## What this module supplies

The binder `hshell` of `ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseSwitchTransport`
and of `ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseSwitchActualPerCube` is reduced
to **one** inequality about the centered shell alone, and the whole probabilistic
and ellipticity content is discharged from the good event.

Precisely, `w1Infinity_sq_le_of_centering_ae` proves: almost surely, on the good
event, and given only

```
hcentre :  ||h - (h)_{z+cu_n}||_{W^{1,infinity}}  <=  K . osc ,
```

where `osc = incrementOscGauge₂` is the manuscript's own gauge
`3^{2n} ||grad(k_m - k_{m-h})||_{W̲^{1,infinity}(z+cu_n)}`, the required
shell-size bound

```
||h - (h)_{z+cu_n}||^2  <=  Delta^2 . S . lambda_{3/8,2}(z+cu_n ; a_{m-h})
```

holds for every `S` above the explicit threshold `shellSizeThreshold`.

Both of the event's inequalities are used, exactly as the manuscript uses them:
the **middle** term (against `shom_{m-h-1}`) supplies one factor of `osc`, and
the **third** term (against `lambda_{1/8,2}`, transferred to the frozen
`lambda_{3/8,2}` by the proved `Provider.BadEvents.lambda_transfer_ae`)
supplies the other.  Their product carries `Delta^3`, and one power of `Delta
<= 1` is discarded to reach the required `Delta^2`.

## The two residuals, stated exactly

* `hcentre` -- **the centering estimate.**  This is elementary at this carrier
  and is *not* an `L^2` Poincare inequality: the shell is `W^{2,infinity}` and
  the localization cube is convex, so `|h(x) - h(y)| <= ||grad h||_{L^infinity}
  |x - y|` on the cube gives `||h - (h)_Q||_{L^infinity} <= ||grad
  h||_{L^infinity} diam(Q)`, and the frozen `w1Infinity = max{ ||grad
  h||_infinity, ||h||_infinity }` is then below a dimensional multiple of the
  gauge `osc`, whose second component is exactly `3^{n} ||grad
  h||_{L^infinity(z+cu_n)}` after the rescaling.  It is **not proved here**: the frozen value gauge is an essential supremum of `matrixNorm`
  and the cube average is CoarseGraining's `cubeAverageMat` at the *unrescaled*
  cube, so a change-of-variables bridge and a mean-value bound at the
  shell-field carrier are still required.  `hcentre` is carried as an explicit
  binder with the constant `K` free, never as an assumed conclusion.
* `hS` -- the threshold `shellSizeThreshold M Ccg K lowScale <= S`.  At the
  manuscript's `S = shom_{m-h}` this is the one-scale comparison
  `shom_{m-h-1} <= 2 Ccg (C_sens/K)^2 shom_{m-h}` of the annealed diffusivity,
  a statement about the *data* of the recurrence, of the same kind as
  `e.cg.ellip.lower`.  It is a hypothesis, not a derived fact.

Neither residual is a predecessor's conclusion and neither smuggles a proof
step.

## Main definitions

* `shellSizeThreshold`: the explicit `S`-threshold
  `K^2 Ccg^{-1} shom_{lowScale-1} / (2 C_sens^2)`.

## Main results

* `rpow_neg_half_scaleGapPos_eq_sq`: `3^{-(1/2)G} = (3^{-(1/4)G})^2`.
* `goodLocalThreshold_eq_sq_discount_mul`: the middle term of
  `e.good.local.events`, in the `Delta^2` form Step 3 uses.
* `w1Infinity_sq_le_of_centering_ae`: the reduction of `hshell`.
* `shell_hypothesis_of_centering_ae`: the same, in the exact binder shape the
  per-cube switch consumes, quantified over the descendants of `Q` at depth
  `j`.

/-- The exponent bookkeeping of `e.good.local.events`: its middle term carries

`Delta = 3^{-(1/4)(n-m)_+}` appearing in its third term.

/-! ## The `S`-threshold -/

/-- The explicit threshold above which the centered-shell size bound holds:
`K^2 Ccg^{-1} shom_{lowScale-1} / (2 C_sens^2)`, with `K` the constant of the
centering estimate and `C_sens = sensitivityConstMax d` the joint sensitivity
constant of `e.good.local.events`.

At the manuscript's own `S = shom_{m-h}` the condition
`shellSizeThreshold <= S` is the one-scale comparison of the annealed
diffusivity described in the module docstring. -/

  K ^ 2 * Ccg⁻¹ *
      ((Algsuperdiff.Section3.Annealed.sigmaBar M (lowScale - 1) : ℝ)) /
    (2 * sensitivityConstMax d ^ 2)

/-! ## The reduction of `hshell` -/

/-- **The centered-shell size bound, reduced to the centering estimate.**

Almost surely on the cutoff sample law: if the sample lies in the manuscript's
own event `cQ_z = cQ(n, m-h, z)` and the centered shell obeys the centering
estimate `hcentre` with constant `K`, then for every `S` above
`shellSizeThreshold` the shell-size bound required by the Young absorption
holds.

Both inequalities of `e.good.local.events` are used: the middle one (against
`shom_{m-h-1}`) and the third one (against `lambda_{1/8,2}`, transferred to the
frozen `lambda_{3/8,2}` almost surely).  Their product carries `Delta^3`, and
one power of `Delta <= 1` is discarded.

: this statement holds only under the propositions supplied by its binders --
`hCcg` (`0 < Ccg`), `hS` (the threshold), the membership in the good event, and
`hcentre`.  It is a provider A, not a source-facing frozen declaration. -/
