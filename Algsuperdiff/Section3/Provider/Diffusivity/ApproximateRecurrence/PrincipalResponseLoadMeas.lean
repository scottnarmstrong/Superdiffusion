# The fresh-shell measurability's load, at the display's own load

Sources in ABK26:

* The sentence "Therefore, by independence of `bfA_{m-h}` and
  `G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z` (the latter is a function of `k_m - k_{m-h}`),
  increasing `M` in `\eqref{e.cgamma.constraints}` if necessary,";
* `e.lower.bound.principal.one.pre` (label);
* `e.Pz.def` (label; display), the load itself;
* `e.Gh.def`, the doubled shear that gauges it.

## What this module supplies

```
Measurable[Cutoff.shellIndexSigma (Set.Ioc n m)] W
```

for `W : Cutoff.ShellSeq d -> BlockVec d`.  It was carried as a binder at an
abstract `W` by every consumer, including
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq_of_representative`.
This module supplies it at the **concrete** load the display gauges, i.e. at

```
G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z
  = blockMatVecMul (blockGauge (-freshShellCubeAverage R omega n m))
      (principalPz sigma omega n m e e' R (wD omega) (wN omega)) ,
```

named `gaugedPrincipalLoadShell` below, and then instantiates the `hWmeas` slot
of the consumer of `PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas` at it.

## The three legs, and where each one comes from

The load has three sample-dependent ingredients, and each is reduced here to a
**continuous** functional of an already-proved measurable `L^2` class over the
large cube `cu_K`:

1. the averaged fresh shell `(h)_{z+cu_n} = freshShellCubeAverage R omega n m`
   of `e.Gh.def`.  Reading the direction `Pi.single j 1` and the reciprocal
   scale `-1`, the field `x |-> (k_m - k_n)(x) e_j` is literally the negated
   forcing `-streamForcing (-1) omega n m e_j` of `e.def.w`, whose `L^2` class
   is the proved `Corrector.freshShellForcingL2`; its fresh-block measurability
   is `Corrector.measurable_freshShellForcingL2_shellIndexSigma`;
2. the potential average `(grad w_D)_{z+cu_n}`, from the proved
   `Corrector.measurable_shellIndexSigma_freshShellDirichletGradL2`;
3. the flux average `(grad w_N + shom^{-1} h e')_{z+cu_n}`, whose integrand is
   the sum of the Neumann gradient and `streamForcing`, hence whose `L^2` class
   is the difference of the proved Neumann gradient class and the proved
   forcing class, both measurable for the fresh block.

The passage from an `L^2` class on `openCubeSet Q` to the manuscript's cube
average over the localization cube `R` is `cubeAverage_eq_of_coeFn_ae`: for a
descendant `R` of `Q`, the restricted Lebesgue measure of `openCubeSet Q`,
further restricted to `cubeSet R`, is the plain restricted Lebesgue measure of
`cubeSet R`, so the class integrates against `cubeAverage`'s own
measure and may be replaced by any of its representatives.  The remaining
algebra -- `blockGauge`, `matVecMul`, `inverseSqrtLoad`, `sqrtLoad` and the
constants `e`, `e'` -- is finite and continuous.

## The matrix side

`hB` is discharged here as well, at an arbitrary representative of the matrix,
by transporting
`Provider.Annealed.coefficientCutoffLaw_integrable_blockMatEntry_coarseBlockMatrix`
across the two carrier changes that `PrincipalResponseIndepWire` already
performs for the *integral*.  See `integrable_blockMatEntry_of_representative`.

## Carriers, disclosed

Every declaration below lives on the shell-sequence carrier `Cutoff.ShellSeq
d`, which is the carrier `integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq` integrates
over.  No extension along `Subtype.val` is needed for the load:
`freshShellCubeAverage`, `principalPz` and `Corrector.streamForcing` are all
already defined at `Cutoff.ShellSeq d`, and the corrector families are taken at
that carrier, exactly as the proved measurability lemmas of
`Corrector.CorrectorMeasurableGradient` take them.
`gaugedPrincipalLoadShell_val` records that at a genuine cutoff sample the load
below is `PrincipalResponseIndepWire.gaugedSwitchLoad` at `principalPz`.

The matrix is not a concrete term of this file either.  Both declarations below
that mention it quantify over an arbitrary
`B : Cutoff.ShellSeq d -> BlockMat d` carrying the binder

```
∀ᵐ w ∂(Cutoff.cutoffSampleLaw M).toMeasure,
  B w.val = PrincipalResponseIndepWire.switchCubeMatrix M L R w
```

produced by
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.exists_measurable_representative_switchCubeMatrix`,
and both are invariant under that almost-everywhere identification: `B` is read
only under an integral or an integrability statement.  No value of `B` off the
lower-tail-good carrier is named, asserted or used anywhere below.

## What this module does NOT supply

It does not supply `hW` of
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq_of_representative`:
the consuming statement below carries it as a binder, visible in its own
signature.  `hW` is the second-moment integrability of the gauged load, i.e.
the standing moment content of `e.nablaw.in.L.eight` (label) together with a
fourth moment of the averaged fresh shell; no bound on either is asserted or
used anywhere below.  Two ingredients that a later discharge of `hW` would need
are absent from this repository as of writing: any norm or moment estimate for
`cubeAverageMat`/`cubeAverageVec`, and any unconditional `MemLp` for the
corrector gradients on `Cutoff.ShellSeq d`.

`hB` **is** supplied, by `integrable_blockMatEntry_of_representative` below,
and that supply is free of good events and of any structural-law or `(P4)`
hypothesis; the one proposition it does carry is the representative binder
`hBrep` described under "Carriers, disclosed".

It does not supply `hBmeas` either: like the representative binder itself,
`hBmeas` is carried as a binder by the consumer below, and at this matrix it is
available from
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.exists_measurable_representative_switchCubeMatrix`.

It does not remove the independence binder `hindep`: that binder still stands on
`ApproximateRecurrence.PrincipalResponseBudgetWire`
`exists_gamma0_descendantsAverage_integral_principalGoodEventEnergy_le_annealedCube_of_centeringConst`
and on its predecessors, untouched by anything here.

It asserts nothing about the correctors beyond the two weak-solution properties
its binders name, and it constructs no measurable selection: the corrector
families `wD`, `wN` are arbitrary, exactly as in
`Corrector.CorrectorMeasurableGradient`.

## Main results

The public surface is the five declarations listed below, together with the two
component measurability legs of the Step-5 basket and their plain-measurability
corollaries (see the paragraph after the list); the remaining nine declarations
are `private`.  The window-average bridge, the class-to-cube-average reduction,
the flux-average leg and the `principalPz` step stay `private`, because each is
consumed only by a later declaration in this file.

* `gaugedPrincipalLoadShell` -- the load itself; it occurs in the two statements
  below, so it must be public.
* `gaugedPrincipalLoadShell_val` -- the bridge to
  `PrincipalResponseIndepWire.gaugedSwitchLoad`, hence to
  `PrincipalResponseSwitchActualPerCube.switchCubeQuad`.  A consumer that starts
  from the display's per-cube quadratic form on `Cutoff.CutoffSample d` needs
  exactly this identity to reach the shell-carrier statement below.
* `measurable_shellIndexSigma_gaugedPrincipalLoadShell` -- the `hWmeas` input.
* `integrable_blockMatEntry_of_representative` -- the `hB` input of the same
  factorization, at any representative of the matrix.  A consumer that
  instantiates
  `PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq_of_representative`
  at any *other* load needs this one by name; it is therefore public rather
  than private.
* `integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq_gaugedPrincipalLoadShell` -- the
  consumer, with `hW` its only remaining integrability input.

Two of the component legs are also public, because the Step-5 basket of
`Closure.Step5Basket` needs them by name for its `hmeasX`, `hmeasS`, `hAmem` and
`hvmem` binders and there is no other route to them:

* `measurable_shellIndexSigma_freshShellCubeAverage` and its full-sigma-algebra
  corollary `measurable_freshShellCubeAverage`;
* `measurable_shellIndexSigma_cubeAverageVec_freshShellDirichletGrad` and its
  full-sigma-algebra corollary `measurable_cubeAverageVec_freshShellDirichletGrad`.

Publicizing changes no statement: the two `shellIndexSigma` legs are byte-stable
apart from the dropped `private` keyword, and the two corollaries are their
images under `Cutoff.shellIndexSigma_le_borel`.

Conditional on its binders `hR` (geometric membership) and `hG` (the a.e.

any `L^2` class `G` on `openCubeSet Q` that represents the field `F`, the
coordinate cube average `cubeAverage R (F . i)` is the normalized window
integral of `G` over `cubeSet R`.  No integrability of `F` is assumed: both
sides are Bochner integrals of a.e.-equal integrands against the same
measure. -/

/-- **The `hWmeas` input of `integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq`, at the exact
gauged load.**

The load `G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z` is a measurable function of the fresh shells
`(n, m]` alone.  This is the literal content of the parenthetical "the latter is
a function of `k_m - k_{m-h}`".

: this statement holds only under the propositions supplied by its binders,
which are exactly three:

* `hR`, the geometric membership of the localization cube `R` in the depth-`jd`
  grid below the large cube `Q`;
* `hwD`, the zero-trace Dirichlet weak-solution property of `e.def.w` for the
  family `wD`;
* `hwN`, the mean-zero Neumann weak-solution property of `e.def.w` for the
  family `wN`.

`hwD` and `hwN` are the defining property of the correctors, not extra
assumptions about them: they are what `e.def.w` says, and at a concrete
consumer they are discharged by the produced-existence route of
`Corrector.FreshShellExistence`.  Nothing is assumed about measurability,
continuity or selection of either family.  This is a provider A, not a
source-facing frozen declaration. -/

/-! ## The entrywise integrability of the coarse matrix -/

/-- **The `hB` input of `integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq`, at the exact
matrix, in representative form.**  Every entry of any representative `B` of
`PrincipalResponseIndepWire.switchCubeMatrix` is integrable on the
shell-sequence carrier.

Integrability is invariant under the almost-everywhere identification the
binder `hBrep` supplies, so the statement is available at every representative
that
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.exists_measurable_representative_switchCubeMatrix`
can produce, and no value of `B` off the lower-tail-good carrier is read: the
transport only ever evaluates `B` on `Subtype.val` images, and only under an
integrability statement.

The route is the carrier transport of `PrincipalResponseIndepWire`
`integral_blockMatEntry_switchCubeMatrix_eq` run on integrability instead of on
the integral: push `M.P.toMeasure` back to the cutoff-sample law along
`Subtype.val`, replace `B` by `switchCubeMatrix` using `hBrep`, push forward
along `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff` to `RegCoeffField d`, and land on
`Provider.Annealed.coefficientCutoffLaw_integrable_blockMatEntry_coarseBlockMatrix`.

That last input is itself free of good events, of `(P4)` records and of any
structural-law hypothesis: it rests only on the deterministic coercivity `nu`
through the two cutoff moment lemmas of `Cutoff. and `Cutoff.

: this statement holds only under the propositions supplied by its binders,
here exactly the representative binder `hBrep`.  In particular it carries no
ellipticity event and no good event.  It is a provider A, not a source-facing
frozen declaration. -/

/-! ## The consumer -/

/-- **The independence factorization at the exact load, at any representative of
the exact matrix.**

Relative to `PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas`
`integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq_of_representative`, two further inputs
are gone:

* `hWmeas` is now the theorem
  `measurable_shellIndexSigma_gaugedPrincipalLoadShell` above, at the concrete
  gauged load `G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z`, and in its place stand only the two
  weak-solution properties of `e.def.w` that the corrector displays already
  carry.  The geometric membership `hR` that the load's cube average needs is
  the same `hR` the annealed identification already needed, so no geometric
  binder is added;
* `hB`, the entrywise integrability of the coarse matrix, is
  `integrable_blockMatEntry_of_representative` above, applied at the same
  representative binder `hBrep` this statement already carries, so it too adds
  no binder.

The matrix stays abstract: `B` and its two properties `hBmeas` and `hBrep` are
binders here, exactly as in the direct predecessor of this statement in
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas`, and at the display's own matrix both are
produced together by
`PrincipalResponseLowerShellMeas.exists_measurable_representative_switchCubeMatrix`
under the geometric inclusion `cubeSet R ⊆ U`.  No value of `B` off the
lower-tail-good carrier is read.

Exactly one integrability input remains a binder here, and it is still open:
`hW`, the second-moment integrability of the gauged load.  The independence
binder `hindep` of the downstream budget wire is likewise untouched, upstream of
this file.
