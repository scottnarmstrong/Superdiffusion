# The sample-dependent competitor: from a fixed field to a measurable `L^2` class

ABK26, `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`, Step 2.

## The obligation this module discharges

`LocalizationFluctuationJointCoeff.measurable_doubledMuValue_meshCellCoeff`
makes the doubled energy value measurable in the sample when the competitor
field is **fixed**.  The Step-2 integrand needs it when the competitor moves
with the sample as well: the background of the field-slope problem is
`P_z(omega) + bfF_z(omega)`, whose two legs are read along the corrector
family.  This module removes the fixed-field restriction, at the only cost that
is unavoidable: the competitor must be presented through a **measurable `L^2`
class**, not through a pointwise family.

## Method

For a fixed coefficient `a` the doubled energy value is a **continuous function
of the `L^2` class of the competitor**: this is CoarseGraining's own Hilbert
realization of the doubled problem
(`MuOperatorRealization.quadraticEnergy_eq_blockEnergyAverage_ of_blockState`
together with `quadraticEnergy_continuous`), packaged here as
`exists_continuous_doubledMuValue_of_class`.  Composing:

* in the class variable the energy is continuous, for every sample;
* in the sample variable it is measurable, for every fixed class --- because
  every class is the class of *some* honest block field
  (`exists_memBlockL2_toHilbertBlockL2OfBlockField_eq`, from the canonical
  strongly measurable `Lp` representative), and at a fixed field the
  measurability is the previous module's.

`MeasureTheory.measurable_uncurry_of_continuous_of_measurable` (Caratheodory)
then makes the two-variable energy jointly measurable, and composing with the
measurable class of the competitor finishes.  `HilbertBlockL2` is a separable
metrizable space, which is what the Caratheodory lemma asks of the index.

**No measurable selection occurs.**  The competitor is not chosen: it is given,
and only its `L^2` class is used.  The block-field representative extracted from
a class is used solely as a witness inside a measurability proof; no statement
below mentions it.

## Main results

* `exists_memBlockL2_toHilbertBlockL2OfBlockField_eq` --- surjectivity of the
  class map onto the doubled `L^2` carrier.
* `exists_continuous_doubledMuValue_of_class` --- the doubled energy value is a
  continuous function of the competitor's `L^2` class.
* `measurable_doubledMuValue_of_measurable_class` --- the generic transfer.
* `measurable_doubledMuValue_meshCellCoeff_of_measurable_class` --- its
  instantiation at the Step-2 cell coefficient, which is the statement the
  `hcomp` binder of
  `LocalizationFluctuationMuMeasCell.integrable_meshFluctuationCellIntegrand'`
  and the measurability half of its `hbg` binder both reduce to.

## Binders

Beyond the typing binders: `[NeZero d]`; the `L^2` membership of the competitor
at every sample (a typing property of the corrector data, not an estimate); and
measurability of its class.  No integrability, no ellipticity constant, no
smallness and no estimate occurs.

## Scope

There is no `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom axiom and no `set_option
maxHeartbeats`.

/-! ## The energy as a continuous function of the competitor's class -/

/-- **The doubled energy value is a continuous function of the competitor's
`L^2` class.**

For every Chapter 2 domain and every coefficient there is a continuous real
function on the doubled `L^2` carrier which returns `doubledMuValue` at the
class of any block-`L^2` doubled field.  This is CoarseGraining's Hilbert
realization of the doubled problem, read at a fixed coefficient; it is the
exact ingredient `LocalizationFluctuationMuMeasCore` already uses to transfer
an infimum, exported here on its own. -/

/-! ## The transfer -/

/-- **The doubled energy value at a sample-dependent coefficient *and* a
sample-dependent competitor is measurable, as soon as the competitor's `L^2`
class is.**

The competitor family `X` is arbitrary: no measurability of `omega |-> X omega`
as a family of functions is assumed, and no minimizer or representative is
selected.  Only the class map `omega |-> [X omega]` is asked to be measurable,
which is the shape the proved corrector-gradient measurability delivers.

on `hX` (block-`L^2` membership at every sample, a typing property), `hclass`,
and `hfixed` --- measurability in the sample at every **fixed** competitor with
measurable components, which
`LocalizationFluctuationJointCoeff.measurable_doubledMuValue_meshCellCoeff`
supplies at the Step-2 carriers. -/

/-- **The Step-2 instantiation.**  At the cell coefficient `meshCellCoeff M m R`
the fixed-competitor measurability is proved
(`LocalizationFluctuationJointCoeff.measurable_doubledMuValue_meshCellCoeff`),
so a measurable `L^2` class of the competitor is all that is needed.

This is the joint-measurability layer's payoff: it turns the `hcomp` binder of
`LocalizationFluctuationMuMeasCell.integrable_meshFluctuationCellIntegrand'`, and
the measurability half of that lemma's `hbg` binder, into the single statement
"the background field's `L^2` class is a measurable function of the sample". -/
