# Provider: sub-step (iii) of the principal response, the independence step

Source display in ABK26:

* `e.lower.bound.principal.one.pre` (label; display), whose derivation is the
  sentence:

  ```
  Therefore, by independence of bfA_{m-h} and G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z
  (the latter is a function of k_m - k_{m-h}), ...
  ```

The content of that sentence, and the only content of this module, is that the
expectation of the doubled quadratic form

```
  G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z . bfA_{m-h}(z+cu_n) G_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}} P_z
```

may be computed by replacing the *random* matrix `bfA_{m-h}(z+cu_n)` by its
entrywise expectation, the manuscript's `bfAhom_{m-h}(z+cu_n)`, while the load
is held fixed.  In the source's index conventions the matrix is a function of
the shells at or below `m - h` and the load is a function of the fresh shell
`k_m - k_{m-h}`, i.e. of the shells in `(m-h, m]`; these two index blocks are
disjoint, so the cross-shell independence of ABK26 applies.

There is **no Jensen step and no convexity step** here, and none is used below:
the load is not averaged, only the matrix is.

## The two carrier binders, and why neither is a proof step

`integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq` carries exactly two measurability
binders, and both are the manuscript's own descriptions of its objects rather
than steps of its argument:

* `hWmeas`, that the load is measurable for the fresh block `(n, m]`.  This is
  the parenthetical "the latter is a function of `k_m - k_{m-h}`" and nothing
  more; the fresh shell it names is the repository's
  `Cutoff.finiteShellIncrement`.
* `hBmeas`, that the matrix is measurable for the null completion of the
  lower-shell local field at index `L <= n`.  This is the statement that
  `bfA_{m-h}` is built from the shells at or below `m - h`; the completion, not
  the bare lower field, is used because the genuine infinite lower cutoff is
  only measurable after completion (`Cutoff.lowerShellLocalCompletion`).

The independence itself is **not** a binder: it is obtained from
`Cutoff.indep_lowerShellLocalCompletion_shellIndexSigma_Ioc`, hence from
`ShellLawPrefix.independent` alone.

The integrability binders `hB`, `hW` are the manuscript's own standing moment
information: `hW` is the second-moment content of `e.nablaw.in.L.eight`
(label), quoted in the display immediately above, and `hB` is entrywise
integrability of the coarse matrix, which is what makes `bfAhom_{m-h}(z+cu_n)`
a matrix at all.

## Main results

* `integral_blockQuadratic_eq_of_indepFun` -- the factorization at the level of
  the `2d` doubled coordinates, from pairwise independence.
* `integral_blockQuadratic_eq_of_indep` -- the same from independence of two
  sub-sigma-fields.
* `integral_blockQuadratic_shellSplit_eq` -- the shell-block form: past shells
  against a fresh range.

/-- **The independence factorization, at the doubled coordinates.**  If every
entry of the random doubled matrix `B` is independent of every product of two
coordinates of the random doubled load `W`, then the expected quadratic form is
unchanged when `B` is replaced by its entrywise expectation `Bbar`.

The load is held fixed throughout; only the matrix is averaged. -/
