# Provider: the localization split at the actual cutoff coefficient, mesh-averaged

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.recurrence.params`: the two scale gates `K >= m + 10^10 gamma^{-1}`
  and `n:= m - h - 16 ceil|log_3 gamma|`;
* `e.recurrence.P.def`, `e.def.w`, `e.Pz.def`, `e.Fz.def`;
* the gluing sentence "Observe that `X_z = S_z + tilde S_z`.  Since. we may
  insert it into the minimization problem in `e.variational.mu.U.P` for
  `bfA_m(cu_K)`";
* `e.variational.mu.U.P`, the variational problem the glued field is inserted
  into.

`LocalizationActualSplit.lean` produces the per-cell fields `S_z`,
`tilde S_z` at the actual carriers but leaves the coefficient family abstract
and the mesh average absent.  `LocalizationGrid.lean` supplies the mesh tiling
identity but at an arbitrary integrable function.  This module composes the
two **at the genuine cutoff coefficient**: the global `bfA_m(cu_K)` and every
cell `bfA_m(z+cu_n)` are the *same* `Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily`
evaluated at `cu_K` and at each descendant cell, and the right-hand side is the
mesh average over the scale-`n` grid.

## The coefficient compatibility that makes "simultaneously at `cu_K` and at
each cell" true

`Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily M m omega` gives every triadic cube
the *same literal* coefficient field `a_m = nu I + k_m`; only the recorded upper
ellipticity constant varies with the cube, and `blockMatrixField` does not read
it.  Hence the restriction of the family's representative from `cu_K` to a
descendant cell is an **identity of functions**, not an a.e. identity, and no
null set is spent.  That is
`toCoeffField_coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_congr` below and its two
consequences; they are what let the mesh step replace `bfA_m(cu_K)`'s
representative by `bfA_m(z+cu_n)`'s inside each cell integral.  A caller working
with a general `Ch02.TriadicCoeffFamily` would have to spend
`Ch02.pointwiseCoeffOnRestrict` and an a.e. argument instead; at the actual
cutoff coefficient neither is needed.

## What is proved

* `toCoeffField_coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_congr`,
  `blockMatrixField_coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_congr`,
  `blockEnergyDensityAt_coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_congr` -- the
  compatibility layer just described, at the level of the coefficient field, of
  the doubled matrix field, and of the doubled energy density.
* `two_mul_doubledMuValue_gluedDoubledField_eq_mesoGridAverage` -- **the mesh
  step**: for the actual cutoff coefficient, `fint_{cu_K} X. bfA_m X = avsum_{z
  in 3^n Zd cap cu_K} fint_{z+cu_n} X_z. bfA_m X_z` when `X` is the glued field
  of the cell fields `X_z`.  The tiling constant is `1`.
* `exists_localizationCutoffCellSplit_blockVecDot_coarseBlockMatrix_le` -- the
  frozen pre-mesh intermediate of `LocalizationActualSplit.lean` **instantiated
  at the actual coefficient family**, `a := (...).coeffOn Q` and `aCell R:=
  (.).coeffOn R`, with the glued field's membership in `P + L^2_{pot,0}(cu_K) x
  Lsolo(cu_K)` carried in the conclusion.
* `exists_localizationCutoffMeshSplit_le_mesoGridAverage` -- **the first line
  of `e.lower.bound.basic.split`** at the actual coefficients, at the actual
  carriers, at the recurrence scales, mesh-averaged.
* `exists_localizationCutoffMeshSplit_le_mesoGridAverage_expanded` -- the same
  bound with the cell energy replaced by the manuscript's **third line**, i.e.
  `P_z. bfA_m(z+cu_n) P_z + 2 P_z. fint bfA_m tilde S_z + fint tilde S_z. bfA_m
  tilde S_z`, mesh-averaged.

## Which printed lines are proved here, and which are not

Proved here (as conditional helper statements, with the binders listed in each
docstring): the inequalities, both mesh-averaged over the full scale-`n` grid,
both at `bfA_m` on `cu_K` and on every cell.  The passage between them runs
through inside `LocalizationBasicSplit.doubledMuValue_add`; the intermediate
line is therefore *used*, and no declaration below states it as a separate
mesh-averaged display.

NOT proved here, and not claimed: any estimate on `S_z`, on `tilde S_z`, on
`bfF_z` or on the correctors; the expectation (Step 2); the reverse of the
insertion inequality.

## Divergences from the printed statement

* **.**  Only the inequality direction of the insertion is produced.
* **.**  The site set `3^n Z^d cap cu_K` is `mesoCubeGrid d K n`, the finite
  family of scale-`n` triadic descendants of `cu_K`, indexed by cubes rather
  than by corner points.  On this family the tiling identity holds at constant
  `1`, which is what the mesh step below uses.
* The line composed below is the full-grid leg, where
  `LocalizationGrid.cubeAverage_originCube_eq_mesoGridAverage` applies exactly
  and no deficit is incurred.  likewise bears on the interior/full mismatch of
  a different average and is not consumed below.
* **: the gap multiplier stays free.**  The meso scale is `recurrenceMesoScale
  a gamma m h` at a **free** `a: Nat`; the printed `16` is nowhere written, and
  no `a >= 28` gate is assumed, because the mesh step needs only `n <= K`.
* **The `K` gate is carried, not derived.**  `hK` below is the printed `K >= m
  + 10^10 gamma^{-1}`.  Only its consequence `m <= K` is used; nothing here
  derives the gate from `e.cgamma.constraints`.
* **.**  Carrier and totalization conventions are inherited unchanged from
  `LocalizationSelectionExistence.lean` and
  `LocalizationGluingAdmissible.lean`: `S` and `T` are total functions on
  `TriadicCube d` and every conclusion is quantified over the grid, the values
  off it being neither used nor mentioned.
* **The factor two.**  As in `LocalizationBasicSplit.lean`, the manuscript's
  `fint_U X . bfA X` is twice CoarseGraining's `doubledMuValue`; the factor is
  carried explicitly and neither object is renormalized.
* **The scale pair.**  `highScale` is the manuscript's `m` and `lowScale` is
  `m - h`: `Corrector.streamForcing sigmaInv omega lowScale highScale e` is the
  forcing `shom_{m-h}^{-1}(k_m - k_{m-h}) e` of `e.def.w`.  The coefficient
  family is therefore taken at `highScale`, which is `bfA_m`, and the meso scale
  at `m = highScale`, `h = highScale - lowScale`.
* **One sample drives both sides.**  `omega : Cutoff.CutoffSample d` supplies the
  coefficient `bfA_m` and, through its underlying shell sequence, the correctors
  and `bfF_z`; no second, unrelated sample appears.

Two ingredients meet here.  The tiling identity
`LocalizationGrid.cubeAverage_originCube_eq_mesoGridAverage` splits the average
over `cu_K` into the average of the cell averages at tiling constant `1`; inside
each cell the glued field is the cell field
(`LocalizationGluingAdmissible.gluedDoubledField_eval_of_mem_openCubeSet`) and
`bfA_m(cu_K)`'s representative is `bfA_m(z+cu_n)`'s
(`blockEnergyDensityAt_coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily_congr`), so each cell
average is exactly the cell's own doubled energy.  The factor `2` is
`LocalizationBasicSplit.lean`'s normalization convention.

: on `hn : n <= K` and on the two `MemVectorL2` memberships of the glued field
on `cu_K`, which supply the integrability the tiling identity consumes.  Both
memberships are discharged from the gluing admissibility at the call site below

`a` and `aCell` are no longer free: both are
`Cutoff.coefficientCutoffTriadicCoeffFamily M highScale omega`, the

from `isDoubledMuAdmissible_localizationBackground` and the cell minimality,

The passage from the previous statement runs cell by cell through
`LocalizationActualSplit.two_mul_doubledMuValue_localizationActual_add_eq`,
whose own route is the quadratic expansion followed by the Euler--Lagrange
collapse of the cross term; the intermediate printed line is therefore used,
and is not restated here as a separate display.  All three occurrences of
`bfA_m` on the right are the *cell's* representative of the same cutoff family
whose `cu_K` representative appears on the left.

Per this direction, and only this direction, is available.  No estimate on
`P_z`, on `tilde S_z` or on `bfF_z` is asserted; bounding the two fluctuation
terms is Step 2 of the manuscript and is not attempted here.

: identical to the previous statement -- `hwN` and the three scale binders
`hgamma0`, `hlow`, `hK`. -/
