# Provider: the averaged fresh shell `(h)_{z + cu_n}`

Source displays in ABK26:

* names the *fresh shell* `h := k_m - k_{m-h}`, the increment of the infrared
  cutoff between the two scales of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`;
* Step 3 of that lemma never uses `h` itself but only its average
  `(h)_{z+cu_n}` over the localization cube, which is the matrix conjugated
  away by the doubled shear `bfG_{-(h)_{z+cu_n}}` of `e.Gh.def`.

This module defines that average as a single `Mat d` and proves the one
property the gauge algebra needs of it: it is **antisymmetric**.

## Why it is skew

The standing assumption `a.shell.antisymmetry` is carried structurally, not as
a hypothesis: the frozen carrier `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Assumptions.ShellField`
bundles `forall x i j, j x i j = - j x j i` into the type of a shell, so every
finite increment `k_m - k_{m-h}` is a pointwise antisymmetric matrix field
(`Algsuperdiff.Section3.Cutoff.finiteShellIncrement_skew`), and averaging over a
cube is entrywise linear.  Consequently `freshShellCubeAverage_skew` is
unconditional -- no integrability, no measurability, and no event.

The antisymmetry consumed here is the separate standing node
`a.shell.antisymmetry`.)

## Carriers

* the localization cube is a free `TriadicCube d` argument `R`.
* the two scales are free integers `lowScale <= highScale`; in Step 3 they are
  `m - h` and `m`.
* the sample is a bare `Cutoff.ShellSeq d`, so that the definition is available
  before any lower-tail restriction.  The two identification lemmas below,
  which need the lower-infinite cutoff, are stated on `Cutoff.CutoffSample d`.

## Main results

* `freshShellCubeAverage`, `freshShellCubeAverage_apply`
* `freshShellCubeAverage_skew` -- the input required by
  `CoarseGaugeCoeffField`, `CoarseGaugeResponse` and
  `CoarseGaugeCoarseMatrices`, all of which are stated for a constant `hbar`
  with `matTranspose hbar = -hbar`
* `freshShellCubeAverage_eq_cubeAverageMat_cutoff_sub` and
  `..._coefficientCutoff_sub` -- the identification of this matrix with the
  manuscript's `(k_m - k_{m-h})_{z+cu_n}` and with the average of the
  coefficient-field difference `a_m - a_{m-h}`.
