# Provider: the bounded-overlap count for the meso windows

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.nablaw.oscillations` (label; display) is stated at a mesh point `z in 3^n
  Zd cap cu_K` and involves the *outer window* `z + cu_{m-h}`, of side
  `3^{m-h}`, which is much larger than the mesh spacing `3^n`;
* `e.lower.bound.oscillations` (label; display) averages the resulting quantity
  over the whole mesh `z in 3^n Zd cap cu_K`.

Because the window scale `m - h` exceeds the mesh scale `n`, the windows
`z + cu_{m-h}` attached to distinct mesh points **overlap**.  The tiling identity
`cubeAverage_originCube_eq_mesoGridAverage` of `LocalizationGrid` is a partition
statement about the scale-`n` *tiles* `z + cu_n` and says nothing about the
windows.  This module supplies the missing combinatorial input: the exact
multiplicity of the overlapping window family.

## What is proved

Write `N = m - h - n` for the gap, so the window at the site `z` is
`z + cu_{n+N} = openCubeAtScale z (n + N)`, and let `I` be any finite family of
scale-`n` triadic cubes, each contributing the window based at its own site
`z = triadicCubeShift R`.

* `card_filter_mem_openCubeAtScale_le` -- **the overlap count.**  For every point
  `x`, the number of members of `I` whose window contains `x` is at most
  `(3^N)^d`.  The proof is one-dimensional and exact: a window contains `x` iff
  the cube's `i`-th index lies in an open real interval of length exactly `3^N`,
  and such an interval contains at most `3^N` integers.
* `sum_indicator_openCubeAtScale_le` -- the same statement as a pointwise bound
  on the sum of the window indicators, which is the form the integral transfer
  consumes.  Since it is stated at an arbitrary finite family of scale-`n`
  cubes, it applies verbatim to the meso grid and to the interior meso grid of
  `LocalizationGrid`, whose members all have scale `n` by construction.

## Divergences from the printed statement

* The count below is proved for any finite family of cubes of a common scale,
  so it covers `mesoCubeGrid`, `interiorMesoCubeGrid` and any subfamily of
  either.
* **The count is not clipped to `cu_K`.**  The bound `(3^N)^d` is the full
  lattice multiplicity; restricting the family to `cu_K` can only decrease it.
  It is also the exact multiplicity, since `(3^N)^d` scale-`n` cubes can have
  windows sharing a common point, so the volume-normalized transfer constant
  produced from it (module `LocalizationOverlapTransfer`) cannot be improved by
  sharpening the count.  That sharpness is a remark about the lattice, not a
  theorem of this module.
* **Nothing here is an average.**  This module is pure counting; the passage from
  the count to a normalized average, including the interior-grid deficit, is the
  separate module `LocalizationOverlapTransfer`.

/-- **The bounded-overlap count for the meso windows.**

For a finite family `I` of triadic cubes all of scale `n`, and for the windows
`z + cu_{n+N}` based at the sites `z = triadicCubeShift R`, every point of
space lies in at most `(3^N)^d` of the windows.  This is the multiplicity that
the manuscript's passage from `e.nablaw.in.L.eight` to
`e.lower.bound.oscillations` needs and does not state.
