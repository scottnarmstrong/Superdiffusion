# The regime arithmetic of the Step-2 annealed Hoelder fold

## The discrepancy this module settles

 ABK26 quotes the ellipticity moment of the annealed Hoelder fold as `C
 cgamma^{-1}`.
The proved producer

```
  LocalizationFluctuationNumericEllipticity.
    integral_gaugedEllipticitySum_pow_four_ancestorAtScale_le
```

delivers instead

```
  E[ (gauged ellipticity sum)^4 ]  <=  ( C * cstar^{-1} * cgamma^{-1} )^4 ,
```

Since `cstar` is a property of the model and not an absolute constant, the
extra factor cannot simply be folded into the `c1`, `c2` of
`LocalizationFluctuationGammaFold.exists_gamma_threshold_holder_fold`: those
must be **uniform in the model**, otherwise the produced `gamma`-threshold
would depend on `M` and the closure's `∀ M` quantifier would be violated.

## The resolution, and the exact cost

The manuscript's own standing regime supplies the two facts that absorb it.  At
one admissible pair `(n, n+h)` the closure reads

* `C * (cstar M)^{-1} <= E` --- the largeness gate, at a threshold `C` the
  *producer* names (`ClosureRegime`'s third clause), and
* `cgamma <= E^{-5}` --- the induction parameter's own smallness
  (`ClosureRegime`'s fourth clause), with `1 <= E`.

Together, `E <= cgamma^{-1/5} <= cgamma^{-1}`, hence

```
  C * cstar^{-1} * cgamma^{-1}  <=  E * cgamma^{-1}  <=  cgamma^{-2} .
```

So the ellipticity leg of the fold costs **`cgamma^{-2}`, not the printed
`cgamma^{-1}`**: exactly one extra power of `cgamma`.  The fold's printed margin
is three powers (`cgamma^{-1} * cgamma^{14} = cgamma^{13}` against the target
`cgamma^{10}`), so one extra power is affordable, and the numerical obligation
moves from `c1 cgamma^13 + c2 cgamma^27 <= cgamma^10` to

```
  c1 cgamma^12 + c2 cgamma^24 <= cgamma^10 ,
```

which `exists_gamma_threshold_regime_holder_fold` discharges for every pair of
nonnegative *absolute* constants once `cgamma` is small.  **The absorption does
not fail**; the only change is the pair of numerals, and both are still strictly
above `10`.

`gammaRegime_ellipticityLeg_pow_four_le` records the same statement at the
fourth power, which is the shape the `L^4` leg of
`LocalizationFluctuationGammaFold.integral_mul_mul_le_L4_L4_L2` consumes.

## The regime also supplies the ellipticity producer's own premises

`integral_gaugedEllipticitySum_pow_four_ancestorAtScale_le` asks for `max (exp
(2 C)) (cstar M)^{-1} <= E` and `E <= cgamma^{-1/5}`.  Both come from the same
two regime clauses once the producer's threshold is chosen large enough:
`gammaRegime_E_le_rpow_neg_fifth` is the second, and `gammaRegime_max_exp_le`
is the first, using the proved absolute cap
`Provider.Disorder.cstar_le_three_halves` to convert the *product* gate `C'
cstar^{-1} <= E` into the *plain* gate `exp (2 C) <= E`.  The threshold
`regimeEllipticityConst C` produced here is the value a consumer must pass as
the `Csplit` of the split input.

Nothing below is a source display: this module is arithmetic, and it is
deliberately separated from the fold assembly so that the numerals above can be
verified on their own.

## Binders

Every statement is real arithmetic under the regime's own clauses (`1 <= E`, `0
< cgamma`, the two gates) plus, where stated, the proved positivity and
absolute cap of `cstar`.  No smallness gate is assumed: the two
`gamma`-thresholds are **produced**.  Nothing about the corrector, the
coefficient field or the sample space occurs.

## Scope

There is no `sorry`, no `admit`, no custom axiom and no `set_option
maxHeartbeats`.

/-! ## The numerical obligation -/

/-- **The annealed Hoelder fold at the regime exponents.**

 ABK26 combines the ellipticity moment, the load moment `C` and the oscillation
moment `C cgamma^{14}`.  With the ellipticity leg at `cgamma^{-2}`
(`gammaRegime_ellipticityLeg_le`) rather than the printed `cgamma^{-1}`, the
cross term is `c1 cgamma^{12}` and the quadratic term `c2 cgamma^{24}`; their
sum is below `cgamma^{10}` for every pair of nonnegative constants once
`cgamma` is small.

This is `LocalizationFluctuationGammaFold.exists_gamma_threshold_holder_fold`
with its numerals `(13, 27)` replaced by `(12, 24)`; both are still strictly
above `10`, which is the whole content.  The threshold is **produced**, not
assumed. -/

/-! ## The ellipticity producer's exponential gate

The proved producer's fourth premise, `cgamma / 2 + exp (-(C^{-1} (E^{-1})^2
cgamma^{-1})) <= cgamma`, says that an exponentially small quantity sits below
`cgamma / 2`.  Under the regime's smallness clause the exponent is at least
`C^{-1} cgamma^{-1/2}` --- because `E^4 cgamma <= E^5 cgamma <= 1` forces
`E^{-2} >= sqrt cgamma` --- and `exp t >= t^3 / 27`, so the left-hand side is
`O(cgamma^{3/2})`.  The gate therefore holds once `cgamma` is small, and the
threshold is **produced**. -/

/-- `exp t >= t^3 / 27` for `t >= 0`: three applications of `x + 1 <= exp x`

/-! ## The ellipticity leg of the fold, under the regime alone -/

/-- **The Step-2 ellipticity moment, with all four of the proved producer's
premises replaced by the regime's own two clauses.**

`LocalizationFluctuationNumericEllipticity.integral_gaugedEllipticitySum_pow_four_ancestorAtScale_le`
carries four ad-hoc premises (the induction state, a `max` gate, an `rpow`
smallness bound and an exponential gate).  Under the two clauses
`Cell * cstar^{-1} <= E` and `cgamma <= E^{-5}` of the closure's own regime, at
the *produced* threshold `Cell` and below a *produced* `gamma0`, all four hold,
and the resulting bound is the **absolute** `(cgamma^8)^{-1}`:

```
  E[ (gauged ellipticity sum at the scale-m ancestor)^4 ]  <=  cgamma^{-8} .
```

Neither the producer's constant nor `cstar` survives.  This is the ellipticity
leg of the annealed Hoelder fold, discharged.

Proved from the frozen theorem `coarse_ellipticity_bounds`, through its
producer. -/
