# Provider: the two Orlicz scales of `e.new.induction.for.shom`

The induction hypothesis `d.mathcalS.def` of ABK26 controls
`mathcalE_{s,infinity,2}` by a sum of two one-sided weak-Orlicz terms, with
scales

```
  A_1(s) = E s^{-1} gamma^{1/2}          (class Gamma_2) ,
  A_2(s) = s^{-2} exp(-E^{-3} gamma^{-1})  (class Gamma_{1/2}) .
```

The budget `delta <=^2 |log gamma|^2 gamma` is the statement that the *first*
scale alone dictates the answer: `A_1(s)^2` is exactly `E^2 s^{-2} gamma`,
which at `s = |log gamma|^{-1}` is the printed `E^2 |log gamma|^2 gamma`.  This
module proves that in the parameter regime of the lemma the heavy scale is
dominated by the light one,

```
  A_2(s) <= A_1(s) ,
```

so that no separate constant survives from the `Gamma_{1/2}` leg.

## The regime, and where it comes from

`l.approximate.recurrence.formula` (label) assumes
`e.lower.bound.cgamma.cond.again.0`: `E >= C cstar^{-1}` and `gamma <= E^{-5}`,
with the constant `C = C(d)` still free at that point in the manuscript (it is
fixed inside the proof, at `e.cgamma.constraints`, label).  Two hypotheses are
used below:

* `hgamE : gamma <= (E^5)^{-1}` -- literally the second half of
  `e.lower.bound.cgamma.cond.again.0`;
* `h : 6 <= E` -- a numerical floor on the manuscript's own free constant.  It
  is what `E >= C cstar^{-1}` delivers once `cstar <= 1`; that last inequality
  is a separately tracked development gap and is **not** used here, the floor
  being taken as an explicit hypothesis instead.

The window hypothesis `8 gamma <= s` is the left endpoint of the induction
window `s in [8 gamma, 1]` of `e.new.induction.for.shom` itself.

## Why the window enters

At `s = 1` the inequality `A_2 <= A_1` would read
`exp(-E^{-3}gamma^{-1}) <= E gamma^{1/2}`, which the linear minorant of `exp`
already gives.  The honest amplitude of the heavy leg carries `s^{-2}`, so the
worst case of the window is `s = 8 gamma`, where the required inequality is
`exp(-u) <= 8 E gamma^{3/2}`.  The quintic minorant
`u^5 <= 3125 exp u` (`quintic_le_exp`, proved from `1 + x <= exp x` at `x = u/5`)
closes it with room to spare once `E >= 6`: the numerical content is
`9765625 <= 64 E^7`, and `64 * 6^7 = 17915904`.

## Scope

Everything here is elementary real analysis in three free reals `E`, `gamma`,
`s`.  Nothing refers to the model, the cube, the probe or the induction state,
and no source node is claimed.  Following the development convention, no
numeric tactic is applied to a term containing `Real.exp`, `Real.log` or
`Real.rpow`: the transcendental step is isolated in `quintic_le_exp`, and the
polynomial core in the private `window_leg_algebra`.

## Main results

* `quintic_le_exp`: `u^5 <= 3125 exp u` on `[0, infinity)`.
* `exp_leg_le_window_gaussian_leg`: **`A_2(s) <= A_1(s)`** on the induction
  window, in the regime `6 <= E`, `gamma <= E^{-5}`.

`E >= 6` and `E^5 g^2 <= 1` give `3125 g <= 8 E` by squaring, using
`64 E^7 >= 64 * 6^7 = 17915904 >= 9765625`; hence `3125 E^14 g^7 <= 8`, which is
the displayed bound after one factorization. -/
