# The principal-response comparison and its gates

The two halves of the Step-3 switch display are stated at different
admissibility gates on the induction parameter `E`: the bad-event package asks
for `c⁻¹ (cstar M)⁻¹ ≤ E`, the coarse-ellipticity envelope for
`max (exp (2 C)) (cstar M)⁻¹ ≤ E`, and both for a fifth-root upper gate.  The
source premises available at this level are the two premises of
`l.approximate.recurrence.formula` itself: a constant fixed before the model
times `(cstar M)⁻¹` below `E`, and `gamma ≤ E⁻⁵`.  They are *not* contained in
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.inductionState`, which binds only `1 ≤ E`, and
they are not carried by the frozen induction command; at the frozen root the
corresponding scale premise is the stronger `gamma ≤ (E⁻¹)^10`, from which the
`gamma ≤ E⁻⁵` read here is obtained in the root assembly.

This module supplies the arithmetic that turns those two source premises into
every gate the two halves ask for, so that none of them has to be carried as a
hypothesis by the comparison itself.

## The admissibility reductions

* `le_rpow_neg_fifth_of_gamma_le_zpow_neg_five'` --- the integer-power gate
  `gamma ≤ E⁻⁵` gives the real-power gate `E ≤ gamma^(-1/5)` that both packages
  consume.
* `admissibility_of_enlarged_const_mul_cstarInv_le` --- one enlarged constant,
  chosen after the two packages have fixed their own constants and depending
  only on them, dominates all the lower gates at once.  The step that makes this
  work is the repository's own upper bound `cstar M ≤ 3 / 2`
  (`Provider.Disorder.cstar_le_three_halves`), which gives `(cstar M)⁻¹ ≥ 2 / 3`
  and so lets a `3 / 2` factor inside the enlarged constant pay for the
  `(cstar M)⁻¹` that multiplies it.  No lower bound on `cstar M` is assumed;
  none is available.

## The scale gaps at the recurrence mesoscale

The two-sided exponent `(n - Q.scale)_+ - 5 (Q.scale - n)_+` of the oscillation
rate is read at the Step-3 orientation: the cube scale is the corrected buffer
`n := m - h - a ceil|log_3 gamma|` and the field index is `m - h`.
`scaleGapPos_recurrenceMesoScale_to_field` and
`scaleGapPos_field_to_recurrenceMesoScale` evaluate the two positive parts
there: the `-5` branch vanishes and the surviving branch is the corrected gap
itself.

## The two rate gates

Both tails of the bad-event package have to clear `gamma⁻¹ + log 2` before the
two-lane fold can collapse them.  The mechanism is the standard one: the
constants are fixed once, before `gamma`, and the whole gain is read off the
two source premises.

* `add_log_two_le_mul_rpow_three_recurrenceGap` --- the oscillation lane.  With
  `2 / c ≤ Cterm`, the premise `Cterm (cstar M)⁻¹ ≤ E` gives `2 ≤ c cstar E`,
  and `gamma ≤ E⁻⁵` gives `E ≤ gamma⁻¹`, so the prefactor reaches
  `2 ≤ c cstar gamma⁻¹`.  That alone is *not* the gate: the missing factor
  `gamma⁻¹` is supplied by the gap factor, through
  `3^(a ceil|log_3 gamma|) ≥ gamma⁻¹`.  Both steps are load-bearing.
* `add_log_two_le_exp_ellipticityRate` --- the ellipticity lane, a genuine
  exp-beats-power step.  The exponent `x := c E⁻² gamma⁻¹` has
  `x^2 / 4 = c^2 gamma⁻¹ gamma⁻¹ / (4 E^4)`; with `12 / c^2 ≤ Cterm` and
  `cstar M ≤ 3 / 2` the same premise gives `8 / c^2 ≤ E`, which together with
  `E^5 ≤ gamma⁻¹` puts `x^2 / 4` above `2 gamma⁻¹`, and `sq_div_four_le_exp`
  carries that to `exp x`.

## The two gates of the recombination

The assembly step that turns the two legs into the comparison itself asks for a
window gate and a rename gate.  Both are discharged here, over abstract reals:

* `inv_abs_log_mem_Icc` --- the window `|log gamma|⁻¹ ∈ [8 gamma, 1]`, on
  `gamma ≤ 1 / 1089`.
* This is what lets the comparison be displayed at the manuscript's own shape `C E^2
  |log cgamma|^2 cgamma` with `C` absolute, rather than at a `cgamma`-dependent
  factor.
* Its only real content is a threshold on `gamma` by an absolute constant.

All of the analytic statements are over abstract reals, away from any model or
envelope, so that no definitional depth reaches the unifier.

## The comparison itself

`exists_const_descendantsAverage_integral_principalEnergy_le_annealedLimit`
puts the two halves of the Step-3 switch display together at one and the same
witness and hands back the combined comparison of
`e.lower.bound.principal.one`: one pair of correctors produced existentially
with their `e.def.w` properties, one coarse-ellipticity constant, one per-cube
bad-event family, and a single inequality between the grid average of the
localized principal energy and the infinite-volume annealed form at the factor
`1 + 3 principalResponseSwitchBudget M E 64` plus `cgamma^6`.  Its two surviving
analytic premises are the two source premises above; every gate listed in this
header --- including the threshold on `cgamma` that the four sub-packages ask
for, which is *not* a binder but a consequence of the enlarged `Cterm` --- and
every measurability, integrability and `MemLp` proposition the two halves ask
for, is discharged inside its proof.

/-! ## The lower admissibility gates, from one enlarged constant -/

/-- **All the lower gates at once.**  Let `cbad` and `Ccg` be the two constants
the bad-event and the coarse-ellipticity packages fix before the model is seen
(their positivity is not needed here), and let the enlarged constant be

```
  T := max 1 (max cbad⁻¹ ((3 / 2) * exp (2 Ccg))) ,
```

which depends only on them.  Then the single source premise
`T * cstarInv ≤ E`, at any `cstarInv` arising as the inverse of a positive
`cstar ≤ 3 / 2`, delivers both lower gates the two halves ask for.

The `3 / 2` inside `T` is exactly what `cstar ≤ 3 / 2` costs: it makes
`(3 / 2) * exp (2 Ccg) * cstarInv ≥ exp (2 Ccg)` even though `cstarInv` is only
known to be at least `2 / 3`.  No lower bound on `cstar` is hypothesised. -/

/-! ## The bad-event leg inside the half budget -/

/-- **The bad-event leg of the Step-3 display, already inside `gamma^6 / 2`.**

* the two scale gaps are evaluated at the mesoscale, so the tail's first
  exponent is `c cstar gamma⁻¹ 3^(32 ceil|log_3 gamma|)`;
* the two rate gates then collapse the sum of exponentials to
  `exp (-gamma⁻¹)` through `exp_add_exp_le_exp_neg`;
* the moment envelope `3^22 . 2 C cstar⁻¹ gamma⁻¹ . Cv^2` is put inside `Cm
  gamma⁻²` at `Cm := 3^22 . 2 C . Cv^2` using `cstar⁻¹ ≤ gamma⁻¹`, and
  `badEventEnergy_budget_le` closes at the tail power `3/8`.

The bad leg's per-cube integrability is passed through from the estimate, which
produces it on its own conclusion side; it is not assumed here and does not
appear among the binders.  The recombination of the two legs needs it.

The four propositions the caller supplies beyond the estimate's own binders --
the two rate gates, `cstar⁻¹ ≤ gamma⁻¹` and the smallness of `gamma` against
`Cm` -- are all discharged from the two source premises by the terminal
comparison; none of them survives there.

: this statement holds only under the propositions supplied by its binders; it
is a provider A, not a source-facing frozen declaration. -/

/-- The budget of `e.use.also.for.the.upper.bound` carries the geometric factor
`3^(2 s G)` at the window `s = |log cgamma|^{-1}` and the scale gap
`G = 32 ceil|log_3 cgamma|`.  That product is bounded by an absolute constant:
`log 3 >= 1` puts `log_3 cgamma^{-1}` below `|log cgamma|`, the ceiling costs one
more, and `|log cgamma| >= 1` on `cgamma <= 1 / 4` pays for it, so
`ceil|log_3 cgamma| <= 2 |log cgamma|` and `s G <= 64`.

This is what lets the terminal display its switch budget at a constant that
does not depend on `cgamma`, i.e. at the manuscript's own shape `C E^2 |log
cgamma|^2 cgamma` with `C` absolute.  Stated over abstract reals. -/

/-! ## The principal-response comparison -/

/-- **The principal-response comparison of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula`,
Step 3, at one and the same witness.**

For a single constant `Cterm` fixed before the model --- the manuscript's own
`C(d)` --- every model, every induction state `S(m - 1, E)`, and every scale
datum of `e.recurrence.params` carry one pair of solutions `wD`, `wN` of the
two problems `e.def.w` (label), produced existentially together with those
properties, for which the grid average of the localized principal energy obeys

```
  avsum_R E[ P_R . bfA_m(R) P_R ]
    <= (1 + 3 principalResponseSwitchBudget M E 64)
         avsum_R E[ W_R . bfAhom_{m-h} W_R ]
       + cgamma^6 ,
```

where `principalResponseSwitchBudget M E 64 = C 3^128 E^2 (log cgamma)^2 cgamma`
carries an absolute constant; no factor of the conclusion depends on
`cgamma` except through the printed `|log cgamma|^2 cgamma`.  There is **no**
separate smallness binder on `cgamma`: every threshold the proof needs is
forced by `Cterm (cstar M)^{-1} <= E`, `cstar M <= 3/2` and `cgamma <= E^{-5}`,
which is exactly the manuscript's "increasing `M` in `e.cgamma.constraints` if
necessary".

with `W_R = G_{-(h)_R} P_R` the gauged load and `principalResponseSwitchBudget`
the named form of the printed factor `C E^2 |log cgamma|^2 cgamma`.  This is the
target display `e.lower.bound.principal.one` (label) at the localization data
of this repository -- one combined comparison, not a pair of good/bad estimates
and not a raw two-exponential tail.

## The two surviving analytic premises

They are the two premises of `l.approximate.recurrence.formula` itself: one
constant fixed before the model times `(cstar M)^{-1}` below `E`, and
`cgamma <= E^{-5}`.  Neither is contained in
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.inductionState`, which binds only `1 <= E`, and
neither is carried by the frozen induction command; at the frozen root the
corresponding scale premise is the stronger `cgamma <= (E^{-1})^{10}`, from
which the `cgamma <= E^{-5}` read here is obtained in the root assembly.

Everything else the two halves and the recombination ask for -- the two
admissibility gates, the fifth-root gate, the window, the two rate gates, the
tail domination, the moment envelope's smallness gate, the four sub-packages'
own `cgamma`-thresholds, the rename gate, and every measurability,
integrability and `MemLp` proposition -- is discharged inside the proof.  None
of them survives as a binder.  In particular the terminal carries no `hsmall`,
no `hEexp`/`hEadm`/`hEgamma`, no `hwindow`, no rate gate and no `cgamma <=
gamma0`.  What remains besides the two premises is standing or source-scale
data: the induction state at `m - 1`, `0 < h`, the buffer bound `h <= 6 cstar
cgamma^{-1}`, the large-cube gate `10^10 cgamma^{-1} <= K - m`, the two
directions, the localization depth `j` and its mesoscale identity.

## The parameters

* No multiplier binder and no range binder occurs; the printed buffer `16` of
  `e.recurrence.params` is not used.
* The good-event half is read at the honest switch factor `1 + (3/2) Delta`;
  the extra half of `Delta` is paid inside the `cgamma^6` budget at the
  corrected gap `a = 32`, not absorbed into the printed factor.
* The bad-event half is folded to the single tail `exp(-cgamma^{-1})` and
  finished below `cgamma^6 / 2` internally, at the tail power `3/8`.
* The coarse-ellipticity gate of the good half is met at `Ccg = 2 Cbase` from
  the dimension floor `(d : ℝ)^6 <= Cbase` carried by the bad-event package and
  `Provider.BadEvents.one_le_sensitivityConstMax`.  No event monotonicity is
  used or assumed.
* The window `|log cgamma|^{-1} in [8 cgamma, 1]` needs `cgamma <= 1 / 1089`.
  The standing `cgamma <= 1 / 4` is **insufficient** for its lower end: at
  `cgamma = 1 / 4`, `8 cgamma |log cgamma| = 2 log 4 = 2.77... > 1`.  The bound
  is obtained here from the source premises, by enlarging `Cterm` past `(3/2).
  1089`: then `1089 <= E <= cgamma^{-1}`.  The same mechanism supplies the four
  sub-packages' own thresholds, so no `cgamma <= gamma0` binder occurs.
* The reading gauge `shom_{m-1}` of the fourth-moment display and the load
  gauge `shom_{m-h}` of `e.Pz.def` are bridged inside the proof by the public
  transports of `PrincipalResponseMomentsFourth`; no gauge identity is assumed. -/
