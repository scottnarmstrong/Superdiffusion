# The scale summation of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`, in the payload's shape

ABK26's proof of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` from `p.bfA.multiscalebound` has
exactly two moves after the block estimate:

2. "**which implies, after summing over `n`**" --- the passage from the
   per-scale display `max_z |b_m(z+cu_n)| shom^{-1} <= C + O_{Gamma_1}(A_1(n))
   + O_{Gamma_sigma'}(A_2(n))` to the display for `Lambda_{s,q}(cu_m; a_m)
   shom^{-1}` itself.

This module supplies the weighted countable step of move 2, the ingredient
behind the *three-slot shape* that
`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/UpperLeg.lean`'s payload binder consumes: a
pointwise domination `X <= Udet + U1 + Uexp` with `Udet` bounded by a constant,
`U1` and `Uexp` measurable, and each of the two carrying its own `Gamma` tail.

## What "summing over `n`" is, formally

The source's summation is: an on-grid bound of the target by a weighted series
of the per-scale grid maxima,
`X <= sum_k w_k G_k`, together with a per-scale three-way split
`G_k <= Cdet + U1_k + Uexp_k`.  Since the weights are nonnegative with total
mass at most `Wtot`, the deterministic part contributes `Cdet * Wtot` and the
two random parts contribute the *weighted countable sums*
`sum_k w_k U1_k` and `sum_k w_k Uexp_k`, each priced by the countable
`Gamma_sigma` triangle inequality `l.Gamma.sigma.triangle`
(`Provider/Orlicz/TsumTriangle.lean`) at
`gammaTriangleConst sigma * sum_k w_k a_k`.

That is the whole content of the source's one-line "after summing over `n`"; its
weighted countable step is `isBigOWith_gammaSigma_tsum_weighted`.  The
*arithmetic* of the resulting amplitudes --- turning `sum_k w_k a_k` into the
printed `C s gamma (2s - gamma)^{-3}` --- is the caller's, and is supplied by
`GridWeights.lean`'s `polyGridWeight_tsum_le`, `gridWeight_mul_rpow` and
`one_sub_rpow_neg_inv_le`.

## Main results

* `measurable_tsum_of_nonneg` --- a pointwise-summable series of nonnegative
  measurable functions is measurable.
* `isBigOWith_gammaSigma_tsum_weighted` --- the weighted countable
  `Gamma_sigma` triangle inequality.

## What this module does NOT claim

At this repository's carrier that is the statement that
`Observable.cutoffUpperEllipticity` is dominated by a weighted series of grid
maxima of `|b|` --- the *off-grid/on-grid `LambdaSq` bridge*.  CoarseGraining
supplies the deterministic half of that bridge at `q = 1`
(`Ch02.LambdaSq_finite_one_le_tsum_weighted_maxDescendantBMatrixNormAtScale`,
`Ch04.LambdaSqCoeffField_finite_one_le_tsum_weighted_maxDescendantBMatrixNormAtScale`);
the passage from there to the measurable representative
`Observable.cutoffUpperEllipticity` is only almost everywhere, and no theorem
here or anywhere in this repository closes that gap.
