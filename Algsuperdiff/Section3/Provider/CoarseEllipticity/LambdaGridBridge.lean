# The on-grid `lambdaSq` bridge: `Lambda_{s,q}` as a weighted grid series

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/ScaleSummation.lean` and
`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/LowerLeg.lean` each retain the *same* conditional
analytic input, an explicit binder called `hgrid`: the domination of the
coarse-grained ellipticity constant by a weighted series of the per-scale
triadic grid maxima.  This module supplies the deterministic content of that
binder and pins, with machine-checked negative controls, exactly which part of
it can and cannot be transported to this repository's Section 3 observables.

## The two seams, and what happens to each

**(i) The index/pole seam.**  ABK26 defines

```
Lambda_{s,q}(cu_m;a) = ( c_{sq} sum_{k<=m} 3^{-sq(m-k)}
                             max_{z in 3^k Zd cap cu_m} |b(z+cu_k;a)|^{q/2} )^{2/q}
```

and CoarseGraining's `Ch02.LambdaSqFinite` is *literally* this, with `c_{sq} =
Ch02.geometricDiscount s q = 1 - 3^{-sq}` and gap index `n = m - k`.
CoarseGraining's own bridge to a *linear* grid series exists only at `q = 1`
and delivers the pole `s`, whereas the consumers need the summation performed
at the `q/2`-power level, **before** the outer `2/q` root.  That is what
`tsum_weighted_rpow_root_le` does, by countable subadditivity of the concave
power `x |-> x^{2/q}` at `q >= 2`; the resulting weight arithmetic is
`geometricWeight_rpow_succ`:

```
(c_{sq} 3^{-sq(k+1)})^{2/q} = gridSumConst s q * gridWeight (2 s) k
```

so the pole is `2s` **for every** `q >= 2`, not `sq`, and the collar absorption
`gridWeight_mul_rpow` of `GridWeights.lean` then moves it to the printed `(2s -
gamma)` (`geometricWeight_rpow_succ_collar`).  This settles the
weight-convention question flagged, and the "`s`-times-`gridWeight (2s-gamma)`"
reading of the printed deterministic pole is *recovered, not assumed*, through
`gridSumConst_two_le` (`gridSumConst s 2 = 1 - 3^{-2s} <= 4 s`).  At the ruled
exponent `q = 2` the two exponents `q/2` and `2/q` are both `1`, the
subadditivity step is vacuous, and the bridge is an **equality**
(`LambdaSqFinite_two_eq_top_add_gridSum`) needing no summability binder at all.

**The gap-`0` term is carried explicitly.**  `gridWeight` covers gaps `>= 1`
only (`GridWeights.lean`); the source series has a gap-`0` summand, the
one-cube quantity `|b(cu_m;a)|` at the top scale.  Every statement below
displays it as a separate summand `gridSumConst s q * (top-scale maximum)`;
nothing is silently dropped.

`A.mk` is `Classical.choose` of an existential and carries **no** pointwise
information about the literal observable, so the bridge proved here held
pathwise for the *literal* observables
(`cutoffUpperEllipticityLiteral_two_eq_top_add_gridSum` and its lower twin;
names corrected; the current conditional/A inventory describes the headline
families) and only almost everywhere for the representatives
(`cutoffUpperEllipticity_ae_le_top_add_gridSum`).  The route suggested by the
genuine centered-cube `rfl` between the two exported observables did **not**
extend: that equality identified two *representatives*, not a representative
with a literal, and two negative controls confirmed it (`cutoffUpperEllipticity
= cutoffUpperEllipticityLiteral` was not a definitional equality; neither was
`cubeUpperEllipticity M Q L ... = cutoffUpperEllipticity M m L ...` at an
arbitrary cube `Q`).

*How it was removed.*  Exactly that change was made.  On the source range `0 <
s` the clamp is inert (`Observable.cutoffLowerEllipticityInv_eq_literal`,
`Observable.cutoffUpperEllipticity_eq_literal`), so **every pathwise statement
of this module descends to the exported observables at every sample point.**
Both negative controls above are now vacuous: the first equality holds (not by
`rfl`, but by `max_eq_right` at `0 < s`), and the second holds whenever `Q =
originCube d m`.

The a.e. shadows below remain true, remain the statements the current consumers
are written against, and are now provable in one line from the pointwise forms.

*The leg-by-leg consequence, restated.*

* **Upper leg.**  Its payload's three witnesses are existential and its index
  set is a single scale, so even under the old bodies the null set could be
  absorbed *inside the witness*: `exists_pointwise_of_ae_threeTermSplit` takes
  the three-term bound only almost everywhere and returns a domination valid at
  **every** sample point, with everywhere-defined measurable witnesses.  No
  a.e. witness is produced or consumed anywhere; `IsBigOWith` is unchanged
  because it only sees the a.e. class (`Provider.Tail.isBigOWith_of_ae_eq`).
  That absorption is now optional rather than necessary.
* **Lower leg.**  Its payload needs *one* witness `Y` dominating the whole
  family `{X L}_{L >= m-1}` at every sample point.  Under the old bodies this
  was unreachable: on the null set the values `X L omega = max 0 (mk_L omega)`
  were uncontrolled for countably many `L` at once and `sup_L X L omega` was
  not known to be finite there, which is the obstruction recorded in
  `LowerLeg.lean` (point 1 of its module docstring) and in
  `Provider/Tail/TailSqrt.lean` (F-1).  **That obstruction is gone**: the
  deterministic content of the lower leg's `hgrid` conjunct is now available
  with the quantifier order `∀ omega, ∀ L`.  The analytic content of `hgrid`
  remains an input of the historical consumers (`ScaleSummation.lean`,
  `LowerLeg.lean`).  The concrete downstream theorem
  `superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_lower_leg` supplies the lower leg through
  a different finite-`q` pre-split route, so this conditional seam is no longer
  the global lower-leg status.  The separate downstream theorem
  `superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_upper_leg` supplies the upper leg.

## Main results

* `tsum_rpow_le_tsum_rpow`, `tsum_weighted_rpow_root_le` --- seam (i): the
  weighted `ell^{q/2}` aggregate that defines `Lambda_{s,q}` is dominated by
  the linear series with the reweighted coefficients `w^{2/q}`, for `q >= 2`.
* `gridSumConst`, `geometricWeight_rpow_zero`, `geometricWeight_rpow_succ` ---
  the weight arithmetic of the `2/q` root: the gap-`0` weight becomes the bare
  constant, and the gap-`(k+1)` weight becomes
  `gridSumConst s q * gridWeight (2 * s) k`, so the pole is `2s` uniformly in
  `q`.
* `lambdaSqFinite_inv_eq_rpow` --- `lambda_{s,q}^{-1}` unfolded as the positive
  `2/q` root of the source's weighted series, at every coefficient family and
  with no positivity side condition.
* `cutoffUpperEllipticityLiteral_eq_coeffField`,
  `cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_eq_coeffField` --- **the bridge at the
  Section 3 literal observables**: at the centered cube they are the Chapter 4
  ambient coefficient-field observables at the cutoff field.
* `exists_pointwise_of_ae_threeTermSplit` --- the pointwise-valid upgrade: an
  almost-everywhere three-term domination with a deterministic first slot
  becomes a domination valid at every sample point, with everywhere-defined
  measurable witnesses.
