# Constant weakening for the coarse-ellipticity tail carriers

Proposition `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` (ABK26) is stated as `∃ C(d) < ∞` such
that two weak-Orlicz displays hold.  Its frozen Lean surface
`Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds` therefore only records
`0 < Ccg`, while several consumers need a *normalized* constant (concretely `1
≤ Ccg`; see `Provider/BadEvents/BadEventLemmaCases.lean`, whose `hCcg` binder
is exactly that gate).  Nothing but monotonicity is needed: the source
statement is *weaker* for a larger constant, in every one of its slots.

This module supplies the three monotonicity facts that make that precise, all
of them model-free.

* `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_mono` --- the lower-family carrier
  `Probability.IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz` is monotone in the deterministic
  shift `b` and in the tail scale `A`.  The witness is unchanged; the
  domination `X L ω ≤ b + Y ω` only weakens, and the tail weakens by
  CoarseGraining's `IsBigOWith.mono_scale`.
* `isDeterministicShiftTwoTermOneSidedOrlicz_mono` --- the two-term carrier
  `Probability.IsDeterministicShiftTwoTermOneSidedOrlicz` is monotone in the
  deterministic shift `b` and in both tail scales `A₁`, `A₂`, by the same two
  ingredients.
* `lowerEllipticityProfile_mono_const` --- the source-corrected deterministic
  lower profile of `Section3/Exponent.lean` is monotone in its constant, in all
  three branches of `CoarseEllipticityExponent` (finite `q < 2` at pole order
  `2 / q`, finite `q ≥ 2` at pole order one, and the infinity endpoint).  Its
  two hypotheses `0 ≤ s` and `0 ≤ 2 * s - gamma` are consequences of the source
  window `s ∈ [gamma/2 + exp(...), 1]`, not extra premises.

The two hypotheses are exactly what the source window
`s ∈ [gamma/2 + exp(-C⁻¹E⁻²gamma⁻¹), 1]` supplies; they are needed only so
that the finite `q < 2` branch's real power has a nonnegative base. -/
