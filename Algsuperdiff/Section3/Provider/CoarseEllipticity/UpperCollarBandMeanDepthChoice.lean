# The source-compatible depth coefficient for the collar band-mean lane

The source chooses `k₀ = ceil (c E⁻² gamma⁻¹)` with a sufficiently small
positive dimension-dependent `c`.  The coefficient `1` used by earlier upper
profiles is too large for the first collar-density exponential after the
square-root/fourth-root interpolation.  This file records that scalar mismatch
and selects a smaller coefficient from the proved percolation rate.

Nothing here changes a source-facing declaration or makes a source-node or
development-status claim.
