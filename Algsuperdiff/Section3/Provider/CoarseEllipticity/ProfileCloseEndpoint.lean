# The `q = infinity` payload, composed at the `sSup` carrier

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/GridDominationEndpoint.lean` proves the endpoint's
own dominations: `lambda_{s,infinity}^{-1}` and `Lambda_{s,infinity}` are
*suprema* (`e.coarse.grained.ellipticity.infty`), so any majorant of the
individual weighted grid maxima majorizes them --- with **no** `(2s)^{-1}` and
no fold.  This module supplies the summation half of the endpoint analogue of
what `PayloadSandwich.lean` does at finite `q`: the endpoint weight, its
arithmetic against the finite-`q` grid weight, and the model-free two-term
endpoint summation in the shape the lower payload consumes.

## The recipe, adapted from the finite-`q` sandwich

At finite `q` the sandwich runs: identify CoarseGraining's Chapter 4 grid
maximum with a `gridSupAbs` at an explicit per-cube family, transport it to the
cutoff sample space, split it per cube, lift the lanes by `e.maxy.bound`, and
sum.  The endpoint runs the same five steps at the endpoint's own scales `m -
n`, `n >= 0` --- and it is *simpler* in exactly two places.

* **No gap-`0` fold is inert.**  `gridWeight rho k = 3^{-rho(k+1)}` covers gaps
  `>= 1` only, which is what forces the finite-`q` producers to fold the
  depth-`0` term at a constant `ctop`.  The endpoint index runs over *all* `n
  >= 0`, so the endpoint weight `endpointWeight rho n = 3^{-rho n}` has
  `endpointWeight rho 0 = 1` and the top scale is simply one of the terms.  No
  `ctop`, no `foldedAmp`, no `foldedBlockPole`.
* **The deterministic slot is exactly `Cdet`, with no pole.**  A supremum of
  `Cdet + (lane at gap n)` is at most `Cdet + sup_n (lane)`: the deterministic
  constant is not multiplied by the number of scales.  That is why
  `twoTermFamilySplit_of_endpointMajorant` returns `Ydet <= Cdet` and *not*
  `Cdet (mass rho^{-1})`, and it matches
  `LowerLegProfile.lowerEllipticityProfile_infinity`
  (`lowerEllipticityProfile C gamma s infinity = C`) with nothing left to price.

The collar is still present and still real.  On the lower route,
`e.slstar.multiscale` normalizes the whole payload by `3^{-gamma(m-n)}` on its
left, so the per-cube estimate enters as `|Xc n R| <= 3^{g n} (Cdet + U n R)`.
The upper source comparison instead leaves its deterministic `C` uncollared and
collars only its two random lanes, so an all-collared reading of it is a weaker
derived majorant, not the verbatim printed split.  In either abstract
interface, `rpow_collar_eq_endpointWeight` is the identity `3^{-2sn}
3^{gn} = endpointWeight (2s - g) n`.  Since `endpointWeight (2s-g) n <= 1`,
even a collared deterministic term is bounded by `Cdet`, keeping the endpoint
profile pole-free.

## What is proved here

* the endpoint weight `endpointWeight rho n = 3^{-rho n}` and its arithmetic,
  including the reduction `endpointWeight rho n = 3^{rho} gridWeight rho n`
  which transports every `gridWeight` summability and pole bound of
  `GridWeights`/`BlockPayload` to the endpoint at the cost of one factor
  `3^{rho}`, and the collar identity `rpow_collar_eq_endpointWeight`.
* `endpointTerm_le_tsum` --- a single endpoint term is below the weighted
  series, the elementary step every per-scale estimate passes through.
* `twoTermFamilySplit_of_endpointMajorant` --- the model-free endpoint
  summation, whose deterministic slot is `Cdet` with no pole, in exactly the
  payload shape `LowerLeg.isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_of_familySplit` consumes.

## What is NOT proved here

Nothing in this module touches an observable: the endpoint sandwich at the
`sSup` carrier, the `e.maxy.bound` lift at the endpoint grid, and the composed
producers feeding `LowerLeg.isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_of_familySplit` and
`UpperLeg.isDeterministicShiftTwoTermOneSidedOrlicz_of_split` are not carried
here.  The summation's own `hdom` binder --- the per-cube block estimate at the
endpoint, uniform in the cutoff index `L` --- is an explicit hypothesis, and
nothing below asserts that it is satisfiable.  The small-`m` branch is
untouched.
