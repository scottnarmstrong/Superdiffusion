# The Poincare carriers are the gauged doubled field and its gauged flux

Source displays in ABK26:

* `e.findSfull` and `e.bfS`, the characterization of the double-variable
  solution space `S(cu_m)` used in Remark `r.cg.poincare.doubled.variables`;
* `e.bfA.magic.swapping`,

  ```
  bfA ( p + p^* , a p - a^t p^* ) = ( a p + a^t p^* , p - p^* ) ;
  ```

* `e.CG.Poincare.doubled.vars`, whose two left-hand seminorms are taken of
  `bfA_0^{1/2} X` and `bfA_0^{-1/2} bfA X`.

## What the module supplies

`DoubledCoarsePoincare.lean` proves the doubled Poincare inequality with its two
left-hand sides written as the *explicit* fields `doubledStateField` and
`doubledFluxField` of a primal/adjoint cube-solution pair.  The Step-2 consumer,
by contrast, holds a doubled field `X` and needs the seminorms of `bfA_0^{1/2}X`
and `bfA_0^{-1/2} bfA_m X` in the gauge vocabulary of `DoubledPairingGauge.lean`.

The two are literally the same objects:

* the state carrier needs no lemma at all: `doubledStateField` is, by
  definition, `blockGaugeUp` -- that is `bfA_0^{1/2}` -- applied to
  `Ch02.doubledFieldOfSolutions`;
* `doubledFluxField_apply_eq_blockGaugeDown` -- `doubledFluxField` is
  `bfA_0^{-1/2}` applied to `bfA` applied to the same field, by
  `e.bfA.magic.swapping`.

Together they identify the manuscript's `[bfAhom^{-1/2} bfA_m tilde
S_z]_{H^{-1}}` with the quantity the proved Poincare inequality actually
bounds, which is the `hpoin` leg of
`PerCubeFluctuationArithmetic.perCube_fluct_le`.

`sqrt_mul_add_inv_sqrt_mul_sq_le_two_mul` records the remaining arithmetic
link: the Poincare ellipticity factor squares to at most twice the
`gaugedEllipticitySum` of `LocalizationFluctuationEllipticity.lean`, which is
the form in which carry it.

## Binders

`0 < sig0` is the positivity of the scalar `sigma_0` of `e.form.of.A.naught`;
`hdet` (or the ambient ellipticity that supplies it) is the invertibility of the
symmetric part at the point, which is what makes `bfA` the matrix of
`e.block.matrix.basic.definitions` there.  No smallness, moment or measurability
proposition occurs.

## Scope

No anchor, frozen theorem or external input is consumed, and there is no
`sorry`.

/-! ## The state carrier is the gauged doubled field

`doubledStateField sig0 Q a v vStar x` unfolds to `blockGaugeUp sig0` of
`(Ch02.doubledFieldOfSolutions (a.coeffOn Q) v vStar).eval x`, so the first of
the two identifications holds by definition and carries no statement here. -/

second left-hand carrier of `e.CG.Poincare.doubled.vars` is the down-gauge of the

This is the identification the Step-2 consumer needs: the manuscript's
`[bfAhom^{-1/2} bfA_m tilde S_z]_{H^{-1}}` is a seminorm of exactly the field
that `DoubledCoarsePoincare.doubledCoarsePoincare_le_doubledEnergy` bounds. -/

/-! ## The Poincare ellipticity factor against the gauged ellipticity sum -/

/-- **The arithmetic link.**  The ellipticity factor carried by
`e.CG.Poincare.doubled.vars`,

```
Theta_0 = sigma_0^{1/2} lambda_{s,2}^{-1/2} + sigma_0^{-1/2} Lambda_{s,2}^{1/2} ,
```

satisfies `Theta_0^2 <= 2 (sigma_0^{-1} Lambda_{s,2} + sigma_0
lambda_{s,2}^{-1})`, i.e. `Theta_0 <= sqrt 2 * sqrt (gaugedEllipticitySum
sigma_0.)`.  This is what turns the *square root* of the ellipticity sum
appearing in the Poincare factor into the first power appearing: the factor is
spent twice in the quadratic term and twice in the cross term. -/
