# The per-scale block payload: `e.slstar.multiscale` lifted by `e.maxy.bound`

Historical conditional routes for the two legs of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` are
reduced, in `Provider/CoarseEllipticity/{LowerLeg, ScaleSummation}.lean`, to a
*scale summation whose two analytic A inputs are named there:

* `hgrid` --- the on-grid domination of the leg's target by a weighted series of
  per-scale grid maxima.  This abstract file does not produce it;
  `PayloadSandwich.lean` later discharges the relevant carrier identification
  on the ruled `q = 2` route, while general `q` remains separate;
* `hsplit` --- **the per-scale block split** `G k <= Cdet + (lanes)`, together
  with the lanes' measurability, nonnegativity, `Gamma`-tails and the
  amplitudes' summability.

This module produces `hsplit` and all the lane data attached to it, in the
**exact shape** the two consumers take them
(`LowerLeg.twoTermFamilySplit_of_gridSummation`,
`ScaleSummation.threeTermSplit_of_gridSummation`), from the manuscript's own
per-cube inputs.  It is the composition of exactly the two source steps
that stand between `p.bfA.multiscalebound` and those conditional payloads:

1. the **per-cube block estimate** `e.slstar.multiscale` (ABK26, label line;
   statement) and its `b_L` twin `e.bL.multiscale` (label line; statement),
   read at one triadic subcube `z + cu_n` of `cu_m`;
2. the **grid maximum** `e.maxy.bound` (`l.maximums.Gamma.s`, label line;
   statement) over the `3^{d(m-n)}` translates, which is the proved
   `GridWeights.gridSupAbs_descendants_isBigOWith`.

The composite is exactly the first display of the proof of
`p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` from `p.bfA.multiscalebound` (for the lower leg, for
the upper one).

## What the payload needs, and what this module adds

The consumers' `hsplit` binder is, character for character,

```
hsplit : forall k omega, G k omega <= Cdet + Uexp k omega                (lower)
hsplit : forall k omega, G k omega <= Cdet + U1 k omega + Uexp k omega   (upper)
```

with `Uexp k` (resp. `U1 k`) nonnegative, measurable, `Gamma`-bounded at an
amplitude `aexp k` (resp. `a1 k`) that is positive and whose weighted series
`sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * aexp k` is summable and bounded by the output
constant.  Section 4 below produces the split (including the gap-`0` fold a
producer of `hgrid` needs, whose lane is a sum of two grid maxima), section 3
the tails, section 2 the amplitudes' arithmetic (with the *explicit printed
pole* `p ! (1 + rho^{-1})^{p+1}`), and section 6 runs the two consumers to their
conclusions.

The `e.maxy.bound` amplitude is `gridBlockAmp d sigma A k`, i.e. `(3 d log
3)^{1/sigma} * (k+1)^{1/sigma} * A`: the `k`-independent net constant and the
source's own polynomial `(m - n + 1)^{1/sigma}` at `m - n = k + 1`.  At the
lower leg's exceptional index `sigma = (1 - sigma_0/4)/2` the exponent is `2/(1
- sigma_0/4) <= 16/7`, the printed `(m-n+1)^{2+sigma_0}`; at the upper leg's
`(1 - sigma_0/4)/3` it is `3/(1 - sigma_0/4) <= 24/7`, the printed
`(m-n+1)^{3+sigma_0}`.

## The exponent-kind seam: a local bridge

`GridWeights.lean` records  an unbridged seam: its `gridNetConst_rpow_eq` emits
`((k:R)+1) ^ (sigma^{-1} : R)` (`Real.rpow`) while its `polyGridWeight_tsum_le`
consumes `((k:R)+1) ^ (p : N)` (`Monoid.npow`), and "no bridge lemma is proved
here".  `rpow_succ_le_natPow` below is that bridge, and
`gridBlockAmp_le_natPow`, `summable_gridWeight_mul_gridBlockAmp` and
`tsum_gridWeight_mul_gridBlockAmp_le` are its three consequences: the local
bridge **rounds the exponent up to the next integer** `p`, exactly the bridge
that docstring names, at the cost of the weaker pole `(1 + rho^{-1})^{p+1}` in
place of the printed `rho^{-(1/sigma + 1)}`.  Since the frozen displays absorb
every `(2s - gamma)` factor into the rare-event exponential, the weakening is
free at the call site and is priced there, not here.

## The collar

`e.slstar.multiscale` normalizes by `3^{-gamma(m-n)}` on its left and the
lifted display carries the reciprocal `3^{gamma(m-n)}` on its right.  A
`k`-dependent factor cannot sit in the consumers' `Cdet`, so it must be
absorbed into the weight: that is `GridWeights.gridWeight_mul_rpow`, and
`forall_le_tsum_gridWeight_collar` / `le_tsum_gridWeight_collar` below run the
absorption at the level of the whole series, moving the pole from `rho` to `rho
- g`.  At `rho = 2s` (the `hgrid` producer's weight) and `g = gamma` this is
the passage from `2s` to `2s - gamma` printed at `e.cg.ellip.lower.pre` and
`e.cg.ellip.upper.pre`.

## Conditional obligations retained by this module

* `hgrid`.  Every theorem of sections 5 and 6 takes it as a named hypothesis.
  No proof of it appears below.  The composition lemmas are therefore
  conditional A and carry no node status.  `PayloadSandwich.lean` supplies
  concrete `q = 2` instances downstream; that does not change the signatures
  here.
* The per-cube block estimate itself, i.e. `p.bfA.multiscalebound`.  This file
  takes `hblock` and its Orlicz lanes as explicit analytic A obligations;
  nothing here proves or narrows them.  Later multiscale providers may
  discharge concrete uses, but that downstream work is not credited here.
* The small-`m` branch (`p.base.case`, `l.mathcal.E.to.Lambdas`): untouched in
  this file.  The frozen base case is now proved, but no application of it is
  performed below.
* The identification of the legs' carrier grid maxima with `blockGridSup`
  (CoarseGraining's `Ch04.maxDescendant...AtScale` vs `gridSupAbs`) is not
  composed in this model-free file.  The later `PayloadSandwich.lean` route
  performs the concrete `q = 2` composition.

The concrete downstream theorem `superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_lower_leg`
supplies the lower leg through the superposed-flux pre-split route, so the list
above is module-local historical A disclosure, not the global lower-leg status.
The separate theorem `superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_upper_leg` supplies the
upper leg downstream.

per-scale split at two scales and one addition of lanes, which is the two-term

/-! ## 5. The collar, absorbed into the weight

`e.slstar.multiscale` carries `3^{-gamma(m-n)}` on its left, so the lifted
per-scale display carries `3^{gamma(k+1)}` on its right.  A `k`-dependent
factor cannot sit in the consumers' `Cdet`; `GridWeights.gridWeight_mul_rpow`
moves it into the weight, which is the passage from the pole `rho` to `rho - g`
(from `2s` to `2s - gamma` at the source's data). -/


/-! ## 6. The compositions: the legs' payload conjunctions, conditional on `hgrid`

Both theorems below carry `hgrid` as an explicit analytic A obligation.
Neither carries source-node status; each exhibits the payload conjunction its
leg's reduction consumes, with every other binder discharged from the per-cube
block estimate. -/
