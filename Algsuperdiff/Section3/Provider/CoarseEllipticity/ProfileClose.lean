# The collar and the constant pricing of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` at `q = 2`

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/PayloadSandwich.lean` composes the two legs' payload
conjunctions out of `GridDomination`'s on-grid dominations and `BlockPayload`'s
per-scale block payload.  What its two producers deliver is a deterministic slot
`(ctop Cdet + Cdet) (mass rho^{-1})` and an exceptional amplitude
`foldedBlockPole d sigma A mass rho ctop p`, at the raw pole `rho = 2s`.  What
the frozen displays require is the *priced* form: the deterministic slot inside
`lowerEllipticityProfile Clow gamma s q` (lower) resp. inside `Cup` (upper), and
the exceptional amplitude below the frozen rare scale
`exp(-Clow^{-1} E^{-2} gamma^{-1})`.  This module is that pricing, and nothing
else: **every declaration below is an inequality between real numbers**, no
observable, no measure and no source step enters.

## The four items, and what each of them is

1. **The collar**, `rho = 2s -> 2s - gamma` (/ 6185 / 6212).
   `e.slstar.multiscale` normalizes by `3^{-gamma(m-n)}` on its left, so the
   lifted per-scale display carries `3^{gamma(k+1)}` on its right.  A
   `k`-dependent factor cannot sit in the consumers' `Cdet`;
   `BlockPayload.{forall_le_tsum_gridWeight_collar, le_tsum_gridWeight_collar}`
   absorbs it into the weight, which is exactly the passage from the pole `2s`
   to the pole `2s - gamma`.  §5 runs that absorption through the lower
   summation.  Its three-term twin is generic algebra, but the faithful upper
   source route applies the collar only to its two random lanes and keeps the
   deterministic slot at the raw pole, as Item 2 records.

2. **The deterministic slot.**  `detSlot_le_lowerEllipticityProfile` prices
   `(ctop Cdet + Cdet)(c_{s,2} (2s-gamma)^{-1})` into
   `lowerEllipticityProfile Clow gamma s (finite r)` on the printed branch
   `2 <= r`, through `c_{s,2} <= 4s`
   (`Book.Ch02.geometricDiscount_le_two_mul`, the bound behind
   `LambdaGridBridge.gridSumConst_two_le`) and
   `LowerLegProfile.lowerEllipticityProfile_finite_of_two_le`.  The output gate
   is `4 (ctop + 1) Cdet <= Clow`.

   **The *upper* leg's deterministic slot must not take the collar.**  On the
   frozen window `c_{s,2} (2s - gamma)^{-1}` is unbounded (at
   `s = gamma/2 + eps` it is `~
   gamma log 3 / (2 eps)` with `eps = exp(-C^{-1}E^{-2}gamma^{-1})`), so no
   dimension-only `Cup` majorizes it; and it need not, because the printed
   per-cube upper display has the deterministic `C` and carries
   `3^{gamma(m-n)}` only on the two random lanes.  `detSlot_le_upperConst`
   therefore prices the upper slot at the **uncollared** pole `(2s)^{-1}`,
   where `c_{s,2} (2s)^{-1} <= 2` is a genuine dimension-only bound --- which
   is exactly the slot `PayloadSandwich.threeTermSplit_cutoffUpperEllipticity`
   already produces.  The upper output gate is `2 (ctop + 1) Cdet <= Cup`.

3. **The exceptional amplitude, and the absorption gate.**  `foldedBlockPole_eq` puts the
   folded pole in closed form `Gamma_tri(sigma)^2 (mass (gridNetConst A)) (ctop rho^{-1} +
   p! (1+rho^{-1})^{p+1})`; `poleBracket_le` collapses the bracket against the window's
   own `2 eps <= 2s - gamma`; and `foldedBlockPole_le_of_gate` proves `foldedBlockPole <=
   eps`.

4. **The upper `Gamma_1` lane.**  `tsum_gridWeight_mul_foldedOrdinaryAmp_le`
   sums the folded ordinary amplitudes at the source's own degree
   (`e.bL.multiscale`'s per-cube `C gamma (m-n+1)` lifted by `e.maxy.bound`'s
   `(m-n+1)^{1/sigma}` at `sigma = 1`, i.e. degree `2`) against `gridWeight
   rho`, producing the pole order `3` --- the printed `(2s-gamma)^{-3}` of
   `e.cg.ellip.upper`, *not* an over-bound.  `hB1_le_frozenUpperOrdinary` then
   proves the frozen amplitude `Cup cstar^{-1} s gamma (2s-gamma)^{-3}`
   verbatim, using `c_{s,2} <= 4s` and `cstar <= 3/2`
   (`two_thirds_le_cstar_inv`).

## What is NOT proved here

Nothing analytic.  No per-cube block estimate (`p.bfA.multiscalebound`), no
`L`-uniformity, no base case, no observable and no measure occurs in any
statement of §1--§4 and §6; §5's two theorems are the model-free summations of
`LowerLeg` / `ScaleSummation` with the collar inserted, and they carry their
`hgrid` and `hsplit` binders exactly as those consumers do.  **No node is closed
by this module**, and no theorem below asserts that any leg's payload is
satisfiable.

pole `rho - g` (`2s - gamma`).  The second theorem is the corresponding
generic three-term inequality.  In the source's upper route, it is used only
