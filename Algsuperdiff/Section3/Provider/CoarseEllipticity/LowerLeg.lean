# The lower leg of `p.cg.ellipticity.bounds`, reduced to a family-split payload

`p.cg.ellipticity.bounds` (ABK26, statement) is split by
`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/Assembly.lean` into two independent legs, each with
its own constant; `coarse_ellipticity_bounds_of_legs` recomposes them into the
frozen statement verbatim.  This module is the **lower leg's** reduction layer:
it proves that leg from an analytic *payload* in the exact shape the source's
"after summing over `n`" step produces.

## The leg's shape, and why it is a *family* statement

The frozen lower display is a `Probability.IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz`: one
measurable witness `Y`, one deterministic shift
`lowerEllipticityProfile Ccg gamma s q`, and the domination clause

```
dominates : forall omega, forall L, m - 1 <= L -> X L omega <= b + Y omega
```

quantified over **every** cutoff index `L >= m - 1` with a **single** witness.
That is the Lean reading of the source's `sup_{L >= m-1}` on the left of
`e.cg.ellip.lower`.  Two structural consequences drive everything below.

1. `dominates` is **pointwise in `omega`**, not almost everywhere.  Every
   payload binder and every constructor below is therefore **pointwise by
   construction**; no theorem in this module produces, consumes or upgrades an
   almost-everywhere witness.
2. The deterministic shift `b` is a *number*, so the source's `sup_L` costs
   nothing extra once the majorant is `L`-free.

## The single lane

`e.cg.ellip.lower` carries **one** exceptional lane `Gamma_{(1-sigma)/2}` and
no ordinary `Gamma_1` lane states this explicitly ("the corrected lane lives on
the U leg only --- `e.cg.ellip.lower` has no ordinary lane, so every
lower-leg-only consumer is untouched a fortiori").  The lower leg's summation
is therefore a **two**-slot statement, not an instance of the three-slot one.
It is not carried in this module: the payload binder below is exactly its
output, and the two ingredients such a summation rests on
(`ScaleSummation.measurable_tsum_of_nonneg`,
`ScaleSummation.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_tsum_weighted`) are proved in
`ScaleSummation.lean`.

## What is proved here

* `isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_of_familySplit` --- model-free.  A pointwise
  family split `X L omega <= Ydet omega + Y omega` with `Ydet <= b`
  deterministic and `Y` carrying a `Gamma_sigma` tail *is* the frozen carrier.
  The witness handed to `IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrliczWithWitness` is `Y` itself
  and its `dominates` clause is discharged pointwise.
* `coarse_ellipticity_lower_leg_body_of_familySplitPayload` --- **the
  reduction**: from the family-split payload the lower leg's `forall`-body, in
  the exact shape `coarse_ellipticity_bounds_body_of_legs` consumes as `hlow`.
  It is a conditional reduction: the lower leg follows once the analytic
  payload is actually proved.

## The historical conditional route retained in this module

This module itself does not produce its `payload`.  The list below records the
obligations of this historical conditional route; it is not the current global
status of the lower leg.  The concrete downstream theorem
`superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_lower_leg` now supplies the lower leg without
exposing this payload as a theorem hypothesis.  The separate downstream theorem
`superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_upper_leg` supplies the upper leg.

Nothing below produces that payload: within these helpers it remains a proof
obligation rather than a source premise.  Concretely this retained route asks
its caller for:

* The frozen `p.base.case` is now proved, but its application and the
  `l.mathcal.E.to.Lambdas` passage are not performed here.
* `p.bfA.multiscalebound` --- the per-scale block estimate `e.slstar.multiscale`,
  which is what a producer of the family-split payload must supply at the
  source's own grid weights `w_k = mass * gridWeight rho k`, together with the
  `e.maxy.bound` grid lift of `GridWeights.gridSupAbs_descendants_isBigOWith`.
* `hgrid` --- the on-grid bound of the target by a weighted series of grid
  maxima.

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/LowerLegProfile.lean` splits that slot into the
three source branches.

/-- **A pointwise family split is the frozen lower carrier.**

The source's `sup_{L >= L0} X_L <= b + O_{Gamma_sigma}(A)` is, in this
repository, `Probability.IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz`: one measurable witness
controlling every index at once.  This lemma builds it from a split
`X L omega <= Ydet omega + Y omega` that is **pointwise in `omega`** and uniform
in `L`, with `Ydet` bounded by the deterministic shift.

The witness handed over is `Y` itself, so no witness surgery of any kind occurs
and the `dominates` field is discharged at every sample point; see the module
docstring for why an almost-everywhere split would *not* suffice. -/

/-! ## 2. The scale summation, in the lower leg's two-slot family shape

The summation itself is not carried in this module; its output is the payload
binder of section 3. -/


/-! ## 3. The leg, reduced to the family-split payload -/

/-- **The lower leg's `forall`-body from the family-split payload.**

The payload is the analytic output of the lower summation in the shape that
step produces it: a pointwise, `L`-uniform split of the whole family `sup_{L >=
m-1} lambda_{s,q}^{-1}(cu_m; a_L) shom_{m-1}` into a deterministic `Ydet`
bounded by the source profile `lowerEllipticityProfile Clow gamma s q`, and one
measurable exceptional lane `Y` at the frozen rare scale `exp(-Clow^{-1} E^{-2}
gamma^{-1})`.

Nothing but the definition of the frozen carrier and the source's own window is
used: `0 < (1-sigma)/2` comes from `sigma in (0,1/2]`, the tail scale is a
positive exponential, and the observables' measurability is the proved
`Observable.measurable_cutoffLowerEllipticityInv`.  The reduction is uniform in
`q`. -/
