# `hgrid` at the endpoint `q = infinity`: the direct, pole-free route

The frozen display `Algsuperdiff.Frozen.Section3.coarse_ellipticity_bounds`
quantifies over every admissible exponent, and its deterministic lower profile
at the endpoint is the bare constant
(`LowerLegProfile.lowerEllipticityProfile_infinity`: `lowerEllipticityProfile C
gamma s infinity = C`) --- **no pole**.  That is not an accident of the print:
at `q = infinity` the coarse-grained ellipticity constant is a *supremum*, not
a series (`e.coarse.grained.ellipticity.infty`),

```
lambda_{s,infinity}(cu_m;a)^{-1} = sup_{n >= 0} 3^{-2 s n} max_{z in 3^{m-n} Zd cap cu_m} |sigma_*^{-1}(z + cu_{m-n}; a)| ,
```

and a supremum of `Cdet + (lane at gap n)` is at most `Cdet + sup_n (lane)`:
the deterministic constant is **not** multiplied by the number of scales.  This
module proves that endpoint at this repository's carriers.

## Why this is not the finite-`q` statement with `q` sent to infinity

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/GridDomination.lean` (at `q = 2`) and
`.../GridDominationAllQ.lean` (at finite `q >= 2`) both end in the consumers'
series shape `X <= sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * G k`, whose deterministic slot
is `Cdet * (mass * rho^{-1})`.  Routing the endpoint through that shape is
possible --- the supremum is bounded by the series, since every term of the
series is nonnegative --- but it is *lossy in exactly the wrong place*: it
reintroduces the factor `(2s)^{-1}` that the endpoint profile does not have.
The theorems below therefore do **not** go through `gridWeight` at all.  What
they deliver is the endpoint's own domination

```
lambda_{s,infinity}^{-1}(cu_m; a_L) * scaling <= V(omega)      for every omega, every L >= L0,
```

from a caller-supplied majorant `V` of the *individual* weighted grid maxima.
Fed with `V = Cdet + (summed lane)`, this is precisely the two-slot family
split that `LowerLeg.isLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz_of_familySplit` consumes, with
the deterministic slot equal to `Cdet` --- the frozen endpoint profile, with no
pole and no fold.

## What is proved here

* `lambdaSqCoeffField_inv_infinity_eq_sSup`,
  `LambdaSqCoeffField_infinity_eq_sSup` --- the endpoint constants at the
  Chapter 4 ambient coefficient field are the source's suprema, non-elliptic
  branch included (there the supremum is that of `{0}`).
* `lambdaSqCoeffField_inv_infinity_le_of_forall` and the two scaled forms
  `lambdaSqCoeffField_inv_infinity_mul_le_of_forall`,
  `LambdaSqCoeffField_infinity_mul_le_of_forall` --- the endpoint domination
  from a majorant of the individual weighted maxima.
* `cutoffLowerEllipticityInvLiteral_infinity_mul_le_of_forall`,
  `cutoffUpperEllipticityLiteral_infinity_mul_le_of_forall` --- the same at the
  Section 3 literal observables.
* `cutoffLowerEllipticityInv_infinity_mul_forall_le`,
  `cutoffUpperEllipticity_infinity_mul_le` --- the same at the **exported**
  observables, at every sample point (the  body swap), in the two legs' own
  shapes: `forall omega, forall L >= L0` for the lower family and `forall
  omega` at the single cutoff index for the upper.

## What is *not* claimed here

No block estimate, no `e.maxy.bound` lift, no base case; nothing below asserts
that either leg's payload is satisfiable.  In particular the majorant `V` is the
caller's: this module does not construct it, and the per-scale split that would
produce it (`p.bfA.multiscalebound` at the endpoint) is untouched.
