# The gap-`0` fold behind `hgrid`

`Provider/CoarseEllipticity/LowerLeg.lean` retains one conditional analytic
input called `hgrid` --- the domination of the leg's target observable by a
**weighted series of per-scale triadic grid maxima**, in one of the two shapes

```
hgrid : forall omega, X omega <= sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * G k omega        (upper leg)
hgrid : forall omega, forall L >= L0, X L omega <= sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * G k omega  (lower)
```

The deterministic content behind such a binder --- `Lambda_{s,2}` and
`lambda_{s,2}^{-1}` *are* weighted grid series, gap-`0` term included --- is the
subject of `Provider/CoarseEllipticity/LambdaGridBridge.lean`.  This module
supplies the one piece of arithmetic that separates what such a bridge displays
from the shape a consumer accepts: the two index ranges do not match, and the
mismatch is a single extra summand.

## The gap-`0` fold, and why it is free

The source series runs over `k <= m` while `gridWeight` covers the gaps `>= 1`
of the proof's own binder `n <= m-1`.  The bridge therefore displays the
gap-`0` summand `mass * (top-scale maximum)` separately, and the consumers'
right-hand side has no slot for it.  It is folded into the series here: for any
`ctop` with `1 <= ctop * sum_k gridWeight rho k`,

```
mass * T + sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * u k
  <= sum_k mass * gridWeight rho k * (ctop * T + u k)
```

(`top_add_gridSum_le_gridSum`).  At the source's own data the fold is **exact**,
not lossy: `sum_k gridWeight (2s) k = 3^{-2s} (1 - 3^{-2s})^{-1}`, so the
canonical `ctop = 3^{2s}` (`one_le_rpow_mul_tsum_gridWeight`) reproduces the
gap-`0` term with the multiplier `mass * ctop * sum_k gridWeight (2s) k = 1` at
`mass = c_{s,2} = 1 - 3^{-2s}`.  Since `s <= 1` on the frozen window,
`ctop <= 9`: the fold costs a dimension-free bounded factor and no pole.

## What is proved here

* `one_le_rpow_mul_tsum_gridWeight`, `top_add_gridSum_le_gridSum` --- the fold,
  model-free: neither statement mentions a coefficient field, a cutoff sample
  or a probability measure, and both are `forall`-quantified with no
  almost-everywhere hypothesis used or produced.

## Why the fold is stated at an arbitrary majorizing family

`top_add_gridSum_le_gridSum` does not name a grid family: it asks only for some
`G` with `ctop * T + u k <= G k` at every gap `k`.  That generality is what the
two legs need, and they need it differently.

The upper leg's target is read at a **single** cutoff index, so there a
majorant may be built from the sample alone and no binder survives.

The lower leg's target is the whole family `{X L}_{L >= m-1}` with an
`L`-**free** right-hand side (that is what a single witness for
`Probability.IsLowerIntegerFamilyOrlicz` means), while any grid family built
from the coefficient cutoff `Cutoff.coefficientCutoff M.nu L omega` reads the
index `L`.  The `L`-uniformity is therefore an obligation on the caller, who
must exhibit an `L`-free family `G` majorizing the folded grid maxima at every
`L >= L0`.  What that obligation amounts to is the analytic requirement that
the block estimate `p.bfA.multiscalebound` be uniform in the cutoff index,
which is how the source uses it.

## What is *not* claimed here

No on-grid domination of an actual observable is proved here, and no block
estimate, no `e.maxy.bound` lift and no base case is claimed.  In particular
`hsplit` --- the per-scale split of the grid maxima into a deterministic
constant and the `Gamma` lanes --- is untouched.  The two legs themselves are
delivered downstream by the superposed-flux pre-split route, as
`superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_lower_leg` and
`superposedFlux_coarse_ellipticity_upper_leg`.

/-- **The gap-`0` fold.**  The source's series carries a gap-`0` summand `mass * T`
outside the `gridWeight` family (against the proof's binder `n <= m-1`).  Any
family `G` majorizing `ctop * T + u k` at every scale absorbs it, provided
`ctop` covers the gap-`0` term against the total weight.

The inequality is proved by comparison inside the series, so the only
summability needed is that of the majorizing series itself: the two smaller
series are summable by domination. -/
