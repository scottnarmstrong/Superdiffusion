# The squared three-term display: what Step 3 consumes

Step 2 of `p.bfA.multiscalebound` proves `e.wave.influence.bound` in its
printed three-term form (`WaveThirdTerm.wave_influence_bound_three_terms`), an
inequality for the **unsquared** amplitude

```
gamma^{1/2} 3^{-gamma ell} || k_L - k_{ell - hsep} ||_{Lbar^4(cu_lout)}
  <=  waveHeadTerm + waveUpperTerm + waveTailTerm .
```

Step 3's `|b_L|` branch consumes the **square** of that quantity,

```
gamma . 3^{-2 gamma ell} . || k_L - k_{n-k-h_k} ||^2_{Lbar^4(cu)} ,
```

after the manuscript's own Cauchy--Schwarz/Hölder step
`(avsum gamma^2 3^{-4 gamma ell} |.|^4)^{1/2} <= avsum gamma 3^{-2 gamma ell}
||.||^2_{Lbar^4}`.  Squaring a *sum* of three terms is not free: the cross terms
have to be paid for.  This module proves the squared display.

## The cross terms

The manuscript writes the three-term bound and then squares it silently.  The
honest cost is the elementary

```
(a + b + c)^2  <=  3 (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)      (a, b, c real) ,
```

i.e. Cauchy--Schwarz on `(1,1,1)`; the factor `3` is sharp (equality at
`a = b = c`).  `three_mul_sq_add_sq_add_sq_le` below is that inequality, proved
as an abstract real fact.  No sharper split is available for a general triple,
and none is needed: the three squared legs are then priced separately.

## The three squared legs

* **head**: deterministic, and the square *collapses in closed form*.  The
  proved `waveHeadTerm_le` gives `head <= C(d) gamma^{1/2} hsep^{1/2}`, so
  `head^2 <= C(d)^2 gamma hsep` --- literally the manuscript's first term
  `cgamma hsep`, with an explicit dimensional constant.  (The square of the
  *minimum* `min{gamma^{-1/2}, hsep^{1/2}}` carried by `waveL4Head` is even
  smaller; the printed `gamma hsep` is what the consumer asks for and is what
  is proved.)
* **upper**: the `r = 2` instance of `e.powerofGammasigma`
  (`Orlicz.ProductPower.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_sq_iff_of_nonneg`) at the proved
  `Gamma_2` leg.  `Gamma_2` at scale `K` gives `Gamma_{2/2} = Gamma_1` at scale
  `K^2` --- the printed *index* `Gamma_1` exactly.  The statement below carries
  `waveUpperScale ^ 2` verbatim and claims nothing more.  The direction check
  the seam needs survives: squaring *divides* the Orlicz index, it does not
  multiply it.
* **tail**: the same `r = 2` instance at the proved `Gamma_{2
  sigma_2/(2+sigma_2)}` leg, giving `Gamma_{sigma_2/(2+sigma_2)}` at scale
  `waveTailGainScale^2`, which carries `3^{-(d/4)(lout-ell)}` --- the square of
  the proved `3^{-(d/8)(lout-ell)}`, computed correctly here.  The printed gain
  is `C 3^{-(d/10) k_0}` --- a different exponent constant at a different argument
  --- so the identification with the printed gain is the consumer's to make, not
  established in this file.  The printed index is `Gamma_{(1+sigma)^{-1}}`: the
  two agree at `sigma_2 = 2/sigma`, since `sigma_2/(2+sigma_2) = 1/(1 +
  2/sigma_2)`.  `sigma_2 > 0` is free, so the printed index is attainable;
  nothing below fixes it.

## What is *not* proved

The instantiation `ell = n - k - h_k + hsep` (the manuscript's own `ell`), the
cube average `avsum_{cu in W(cu_n,k)}` in front of the display, and the Hölder
step that produced the square are the consumer's; this module squares the
*pointwise* display only.
