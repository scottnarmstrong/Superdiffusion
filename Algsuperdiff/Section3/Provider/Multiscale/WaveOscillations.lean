# `p.bfA.multiscalebound`, Step 2: wave oscillations across the random separation

This module develops conditional infrastructure for the node
`p.bfA.multiscalebound`, the wave-oscillations step (ABK26, proof of Proposition
`p.bfA.multiscalebound`, Step 2): the wave contribution is decomposed over the
layers lying between the field scale `ell` and the random depth `hsep`, and
each layer is priced separately.  It does **not** realize or close the exact
source node; the divergences recorded below remain part of the current theorem
statements.

## The display, and the corrections that shape it

The manuscript's display `e.wave.influence.bound` reads

```
  c gamma^{1/2} 3^{-gamma(n-k-h_k)} ||k_L - k_{n-k-h_k}||_{L^4bar(cu_{n-k})}
     <= gamma^{1/2} hsep^{1/2} + O_{Gamma_2}(gamma^{1/2}(L-l)^{1/2} 3^{gamma(L-l)})
        + O_{Gamma_{2(1+sigma)^{-1}}}(sigma^{-1} 3^{-(d/8)k_0}) ,
```

with `l = n - k - h_k + hsep = n - k - ceil(b(1-b)^{-1}k) - k_0` deterministic.

* **** (a genuine correction).  The printed left-hand prefactor is
  `3^{-gamma(n-k-h_k)} = 3^{-gamma l} 3^{gamma hsep}`, larger than `3^{-gamma
  l}` by the unbounded random factor `3^{gamma hsep}`.  Every step of the
  display's own proof and its Step-3 consumer carry `3^{-gamma l}`.  The local
  formulation uses the corrected prefactor `gamma^{1/2} 3^{-gamma l}` and the
  increment `k_L - k_{l - hsep}`; the parameters are named `ell = l` and `lout
  = n - k` here.
* **** (a form choice).  The manuscript splits the increment and applies a
  triangle inequality in the cube-averaged norm `||.||_{L^4bar(cu_{n-k})}`.
  This repository has no such norm and needs none: the wave amplitude is
  represented by the *uniform* gauge on the observation cube, and the split is
  performed at the level of the layer decomposition `k_b - k_a = sum_{a < k <=
  b} j_k`, where the proved per-layer `Gamma_2` displays live.  Every `Gamma_2`
  factor below is therefore a **per-layer cube supremum**, not a whole
  increment norm.
* **** (a form choice).  The manuscript writes the random-index sum `sum_h
  1_{{hsep = h}} ||k_l - k_{l-h}||`.  On the layer sum this becomes `sum_i
  1_{{i < hsep}} ||j_{l-i}||`, identical bookkeeping for nonnegative per-layer
  quantities, but with *measurable* summands, which the countable `Gamma_sigma`
  triangle inequality requires.  The abstract assembly is
  `WaveOscillationsCore.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_truncatedSum`.

The Orlicz exponent of the lower leg is kept free: `e.indc.O.sigma` is applied
at a general `sigma_2 > 0`, where the manuscript fixes `t = sigma/2`, i.e.
`sigma_2 = 2/sigma`.  At that value the delivered exponent `2 sigma_2/(2 +
sigma_2)` is exactly the printed `2(1+sigma)^{-1}`, so the Gamma index
specializes to the manuscript's on the nose.  (The truncation scale is a
factor-2 stronger exponent than the printed display — `3^{-(1-sigma)b sigma
h/2}` here vs the printed `…/4` — so the printed bound is implied with slack.)

Two other conventions of the local formulation are both strengthenings.  The
manuscript's left-hand constant `c` is taken to be `1` (the usual `0 < c ≤ 1 ≤
C` convention; the tex does not pin `c`, and `c = 1` is the strongest reading),
and the amplitude is the **uniform** (`L^infty`) size of the increment at every
point of the open cube `cu_lout`.  Passing to the manuscript's cube-averaged
`L-bar^4` amplitude costs constant `1`, NOT a dimensional factor: the tex's own
linear-algebra convention makes `|·|` the matrix O norm (= CoarseGraining
`matrixOperatorNorm`), and an average of a pointwise-dominated quantity is
dominated with constant 1.

Two further entries are consumed rather than corrected: (the shift-free `hsep`
carrier of `Provider.Percolation.MinimalScaleSeparation`, whose `sInf` junk
value and standing nonemptiness binder this module never needs, because it only
uses the *tail* of `3^{b hsep}` and the events `{i < hsep}`) (the `3^{gamma
hsep}` collapse, which belongs to Step 3, not here).

## Divergences from the printed right-hand side, recorded honestly

* The manuscript's **first** (`gamma^{1/2} hsep^{1/2}`) and **third**
  (`O_{Gamma_{2(1+sigma)^{-1}}}(sigma^{-1} 3^{-(d/8)k_0})`) terms are delivered
  **merged** into a single `Gamma_{2 sigma_2/(2+sigma_2)}` lower leg, an
  explicit convergent series carrying **no** `3^{-(d/8)k_0}` decay.  The reason
  is a missing dependency, not a defect of this step: the split needs the
  large-scale gain of `l.km.kn.Lp.estimates` (`e.km.kn.Lp` at `p = 4`), i.e. a
  per-layer bound of the shape "deterministic head `+` geometrically decaying
  `Gamma_2` tail".  The proved per-layer input here (`e.km.kn.Linfty`,
  `Provider.Stream.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_largeCubeSupBound`) has a single
  `Gamma_2` envelope with no gain.  No uniform (`L^infinity`) per-layer gauge
  can carry the `3^{-(d/8)k_0}` gain: the gain is a cube-averaging phenomenon,
  and a bound on the supremum of a stationary nondegenerate field over a
  growing cube cannot decay in the cube size (the proved `e.km.kn.Linfty`
  amplitude in fact grows like `(lout-ell+i)^{1/2}`).  The third-term split
  therefore requires re-basing the lower leg onto the manuscript's own
  `L-bar^4` average — i.e. reversing the form choice for that term only,
  reinstating the `L-bar^4` Minkowski step
  there.  The truncated-sum assembly
  (`WaveOscillationsCore.isBigOWith_gammaSigma_truncatedSum`) is unaffected,
  and the re-basing is performed in `WaveThirdTerm.lean`, whose head-plus-tail
  split `streamIncrementLpNorm_le_waveL4Head_add_waveL4Tail` is the `L-bar^4`
  form of the per-layer input; it consumes `IncrementLpLarge` and, for the
  squared form, `IncrementLpSquared`.  The printed endpoint is still not
  matched there: the exact layer specialization and the final tail-series
  comparison are not proved.
* The `Gamma_2` leg carries a covering penalty built from
  `Provider.Stream.largeCubeLogConst` and the dimensional constant
  `streamLinftyConst d` of `e.km.kn.Linfty` in place of the printed bare
  `gamma^{1/2}(L-l)^{1/2}`, and `min{gamma^{-1/2},(L-l)^{1/2}}` is relaxed to
  `(L-l)^{1/2}`.

## Measurability of `hsep`

ABK26 asserts that `hsep` is a random variable, and the proved
`Provider.Percolation.MinimalScaleSeparation` module leaves the `Measurable`
statement as A hygiene for the first consumer.  This module is that consumer,
and proves what it needs: `measurableSet_lt_hsep`.  The proof is elementary —
the bad-site pattern ranges over the finitely many subsets of `cubeFinset h`,
each with a measurable defining event — so no hypothesis is assumed.

## Main results

* `measurableSet_lt_hsep`: `{i < hsep}` is measurable, so `hsep` is a random
  variable at the level the wave step needs it.
