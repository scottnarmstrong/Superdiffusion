# Seam 3: the `ĥ_sep` decomposition at the `b_L` seam

The per-cube `Γ₁` pricing of the seam's layer object is available at a
*deterministic* shell pair only, and supplying the deterministic index is what
**seam 3** means.  `Provider/Multiscale/ConclusionSeam2.lean` records the same
gap: `ℓ` and the shell index `ℓ − ĥ_sep` are sample-dependent, while a
weak-Orlicz statement needs a deterministic index.

This module fixes the carrier that seam 3 is stated at: the seam's layer object
read at a deterministic index.  The decomposition that would close the gap ---
split the sample space over the countably many values of `ĥ_sep`, apply the
deterministic-index estimate on each piece, and pay for the pieces above a
cut-off `H` with the proved tail of `ĥ_sep` --- is described below, so that the
carrier can be read against it; it is not performed here.

## The shape of the answer

There is no free lunch: the diagonal observable `ω ↦ X_{ĥ_sep(ω)}(ω)` is NOT
`Γ_σ` at the common scale of the family `X_h`, and nothing below claims it is.
What is true is the finite-cut-off tail bound

```
P[ X_{ĥ_sep(ω)}(ω) > A t ]  ≤  (H+1) e^{-t^σ}  +  P[ ĥ_sep > H ] ,
```

for every `H`, every `t ≥ 1` and every common scale `A` dominating the `H+1`
individual scales.  At an abstract family and an abstract `ℕ`-valued index this
is a pure measure-theoretic decomposition (the events `{ĥ_sep = h}` for `h ≤ H`
together with `{ĥ_sep > H}` cover, and the diagonal event meets the `h`-th
piece inside the `h`-th tail event); it needs NO measurability of the index and
NO independence, only monotonicity, countable subadditivity on a finite union
and finiteness of the measure.

Two remarks on why this is the honest shape.

* The naive `∑_h P[X_h > At]` over all `h` diverges: each term is bounded by
  `e^{-t^σ}` uniformly in `h`, so the sum over the infinitely many values of
  `ĥ_sep` is useless.  The cut-off `H` is what makes the decomposition
  summable, and the price is the second term.
* The second term is not an assumption: it is the proved
  `Percolation.measureReal_scaleSeparationFail_le_of_gates` (`e.hsep.tails`)
  read through `Percolation.scaleSeparationFail_eq`, giving `P[ĥ_sep > H] ≤
  C(σ,b) exp(−3^{(1−σ)bH})` for `H ≥ 1`
  (`RandomHsepAllLWaveEnvelope.measureReal_lt_hsep_le_of_gates`).  So the
  composed bound has NO undischarged probabilistic input.

## The instantiation at the seam

`seamLayerObject M m h k ℓ h' L` is the seam's own left-hand quantity

```
γ 3^{−2γℓ} ( ∑_{□ ∈ 𝒲(□_m,k)} (|□|/|□_m|) ⨍_□ |k_L − k_{ℓ−h'}|⁴ )^{1/2}
```

at the deterministic index `h'`.  It is exactly the quantity the per-cube `Γ₁`
pricing is stated at, with `n1 = ℓ − h'` and `n2 = L`, and its scale keeps the
layer's own mass fraction `6d·3^{−k}`; reading it at the DIAGONAL index
`h' = ĥ_sep(ω)` is what the decomposition above has to be applied to.

The composition itself is not carried out here.  Its one interface datum is
`hA`, a common scale dominating the `H+1` individual scales; that is a datum
and not a theorem because `streamIncrementLpMassScale M 4 (ℓ−h) L` varies with
`h` and this repository has no monotonicity statement for it (see "What is not
proved").

## The `3^{γ ĥ_sep}` re-pricing

The other half of the seam is the pointwise split, for every nonnegative `Y`,

```
3^{γ ĥ_sep} Y  ≤  2 Y + Z Y ,        Z = 3^{γ ĥ_sep} 1_{γ ĥ_sep > 3^{−4}} ,
```

with `Z` carried at `Γ_{(1−σ)σ₂/((1−σ)+σ₂)}` and at the explicit
`exp(−cγ^{−1})`-sized scale of `HsepReduction`, which is where that half is
proved.  It is the `HsepReduction` display multiplied by a nonnegative factor,
at the honest product index; neither `Γ₄` nor `Γ₂` is claimed anywhere, and no
new Orlicz input is used.

## What is *not* proved

* **`hA` is not discharged.**  A common scale for `h ≤ H` requires monotonicity
  (or an explicit envelope) of `h ↦ streamIncrementLpMassScale M 4 (ℓ−h) L`,
  which is not proved.  This is the precise missing input, named here rather
  than smuggled: it is a property of `e.kmn.bounds`' envelope, not of the seam.
* **No `Γ_σ` statement for the diagonal observable.**  The decomposition above
  yields a tail bound at a fixed `t`, not an `IsBigOWith`; converting it into
  one needs `H = H(t)`.  The optimization is not made in THIS file.
* **No `k`-decay and no printed per-layer weight**: blocks `3^{−3k/4}`
  independently, and nothing here approaches it.  The `6d·3^{−k}` inside the
  scale is the proved Whitney layer mass fraction
  `LayerMass.sum_cubeMassRatio_whitneyLayer_le`, unchanged.
* **The first printed inequality of the display** (per-simplex to per-cube)
  remains unlanded, exactly as `ConclusionSeam2` records.
