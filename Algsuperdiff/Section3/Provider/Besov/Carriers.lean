# Carriers for the Section 3.5 negative-norm estimates

This module fixes the deterministic comparison vector used by the negative-norm
lemmas of Section 3.5 of ABK26.

* `coarseScaleSeparation` is the manuscript comparison vector
  `\s_*^{-1}(\cu_m)(q + \k(\cu_m)p) - p`, written literally from the Chapter 2
  coarse matrices.

The single theorem of the file identifies `coarseScaleSeparation` with the
Chapter 4 measurable representative of the whole-cube maximizer gradient
average, which is the manuscript's `e.v.spatial.averages` on this carrier.

## Formalization readings

Two readings are recorded so the correspondence with the manuscript is
unambiguous.

1. *Everything is volume normalized.*  ABK26 writes the Section 3.5 displays
   with normalized averages `\fint_U`, and that is the reading taken here: the
   Chapter 2 normalized average over the domain of a triadic cube is literally
   the cube average of the same cube, which is what
   `ch02_average_cubeDomain_eq_cubeAverage` records.  No factor `|U|`
   separates the two sides of the identity below.
2. *The comparison vector is written from the coarse matrices, not
   reformulated.*  `coarseScaleSeparation` applies `Ch02.sigmaStarInvCoarse`
   and `Ch02.kappaCoarse`, at the coefficient field restricted to `Q`, to the
   pair `(p, q)` exactly as printed.  Its identification with the Chapter 4
   maximizer-gradient average is then a theorem about that literal expression
   rather than a matter of definition.
