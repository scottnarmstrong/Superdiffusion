# The multi-component competitor: superposition over the components of `ℐ`

`GlobalCompetitor.lean` builds, **for one bad family `C`**, the competitor
`ℓ̂_p^C = globalCompetitor m s C p` on the uniform scale-`s` Kuhn mesh of the
root cube, at that family's own common coarse scale `s = simplexScale m hn j`,
and proves the three `sum_of_a_decomp` clauses at `C`.  This module supplies a
local bridge from that A to the consumer's `badFamily`-indexed clauses: the
**superposition over the distinct connected components** of the bad family.

## Which branch this follows, and why

> Define the global modified affine by assigning the vertex data once on the >
full simplex complex, **or** superpose the component corrections while >
allowing overlap on good cubes.  [.] In the latter presentation one must >
retain a uniform overlap multiplicity (or merge components whose collars >
overlap) in the gradient and energy constants.

(The multiplicity obligation of the second sentence belongs to the summed
gradient estimate and is deliberately deferred — see the Scope section;
quotation expanded.)

The first branch is dissolved **at the vertex-datum level** by
`CompetitorVertexData.lean` (`claimedBadComponent_eq_badComponent`: at most one
component ever claims a vertex).

This module therefore follows the **second branch** (its construction clause
verbatim; its multiplicity clause deferred as noted above): it superposes the
per-component corrections, each built on *its own* component mesh at *its own*
common coarse scale, and it **allows them to overlap on good cubes**.  Nothing
below asserts, or uses, any disjointness of the collars `𝒩(𝒞)`; the pointwise
"at most one nonzero summand" property of the vertex datum is *not* lifted to
the function level and is *not* needed.

> the neighborhood of one component does not contain a bad cube belonging to
> another component

which is `notMem_whitneyNeighborhood_of_ne` below (two lines from `BadChain`
maximality), and which is exactly what clause 1 needs.  Clause 3 needs only the
monotonicity `𝒞 ⊆ ℐ ⟹ 𝒩(𝒞) ⊆ 𝒩(ℐ)`.

## Scope: what this module does NOT do

* Consequently **nothing below identifies `superposedCompetitorSlope` with a
  distributional gradient**; as in `GlobalCompetitor.lean` the field is a
  *defined* piecewise-constant object and the three clauses are statements
  about it.  `e.hat.linear.1` (the `H¹₀` leg) and the `hF`/`hG` binders of
  `sum_of_a_decomp` are untouched.
* **No gradient estimate.**  The summed active-component replacement for the
  false component-local gradient bound is **read and not consumed**: no
  diameter, no overlap count and no constant occurs below.
* **The two-layer window per component is a hypothesis** (`hwin`), exactly as in
  `CommonCoarseMesh.lean` and `GlobalCompetitor.lean` — but unlike there it is
  *discharged* in this file at the manuscript's own bad family
  (`badComponents_window_badFamily`).
* No three-layer window is used; no face-to-face property of `SW(□_m)` is used.

## References

* ABK26, (`l.piecewise.affine.approx`, `e.hat.linear.properties`; clause 1,
  clause 3), (the false disjointness), (Step 1), (`ℐ`, `𝒩(𝒥)`), (the
  components), (`l.bad.clusters.geometry` clause (1)), (`ℓ_e`).
* Its subtype index on the bad components, and its local-finiteness and
  continuity endpoints, have **no counterpart here**: the components are
  indexed by the sets themselves and no local finiteness is used.

directly from maximality": a bad cube of one component lies off the touching

belongs to it.

are **not** assumed disjoint anywhere. -/

* the field is constant on the open cell — every summand is, by the
  corresponding clause at its own component;
* the constant is `0` when the cell's Whitney cube `□` is **bad**: `□` belongs
  to exactly one component `𝒞₀`, whose correction contributes `0 − p`, while
  every other component has `□ ∉ 𝒩(𝒞)` by `notMem_whitneyNeighborhood_of_ne`
  and contributes `p − p = 0` — this is clause 1 of `e.hat.linear.properties`
  at the full family;
* the constant is `p` when `□` lies off `𝒩(ℐ)`: then `□ ∉ 𝒩(𝒞)` for every
  component, and every summand is `0` — clause 3.

No disjointness of collars, no overlap count and no finiteness of the component
family is used. -/
