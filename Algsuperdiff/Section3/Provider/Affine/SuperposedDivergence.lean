# `∇·D̂_q` at the superposed competitor (the `G`-leg of the superposed branch)

`CollarLayerEnvelopeG.lean` builds the manuscript's antisymmetric matrix `D̂_q`
(`e.hatdq`) and its cell divergence `∇·D̂_q(𝔰)` at the **single-mesh**
competitor family `ℓ̂_p = competitorVertexData ℐ p`.  This module runs the
*same* construction on the **superposed** family `ℓ̂_p = ℓ_p + Σ_𝒞 (ℓ̂_p^𝒞 −
ℓ_p)`, the second of the two admissible constructions, and provides the
following local `G`-leg objects and estimates:

* the field `superposedCompetitorDivergence` — this is `∇·D̂_q`, the object
  `e.hat.D.bc` speaks about, and the object whose solenoidality is the `hG` leg
  of `Multiscale.sum_of_a_decomp_cutoff`;
* its cell constants `superposedCompetitorCellDivergence`;
* the three cell-constant clauses of `e.hat.linear.properties` at that field
  (`hGc`, `hbadG`, `hoffG`); and
* its collar layer envelope, at `superposedDivConst d = 2 · superposedGradConst d`.

## Why this module exists (finding M-1)

The superposed branch of the Step-3 conclusion had used
`superposedCompetitorSlope … q` — the **gradient** construction re-run at the
load `q` — in its `G` leg.  That is the wrong object: the manuscript's `G` leg
is `∇·D̂_q`, the divergence of the antisymmetric matrix built from the `d`
basis members `ℓ̂_{e_i}`, not `∇ℓ̂_q`.  The two agree neither in law nor in
shape, and the solenoidality binder stated at `∇ℓ̂_q` is refutable.  Everything
below is stated at `∇·D̂_q`; nothing below refers to, or corrects, the branch
that used the gradient.

## The object

For the superposed family, `e.hatdq` reads entrywise

```
(D̂_q)_{ij} = (d − 1)⁻¹ ( q_j ℓ̂_{e_i} − q_i ℓ̂_{e_j} ) ,
```

which is `superposedCompetitorAntisymEntry`: `competitorAntisymDatum`'s formula
with the single-mesh vertex datum replaced by the superposed competitor, so
only the `d` basis members occur, exactly as printed, and **no linearity of `p
↦ ℓ̂_p` is assumed** (`e.hat.linear.linearity`, is not used).
`superposedCompetitorAntisymEntry_antisymm` is the antisymmetry.

At the manuscript's divergence convention `(∇·A)_j = ∑_i ∂_{x_i} A_{ij}` (the
footnote) the `j`-th coordinate of `∇·D̂_q` is the sum over `i` of the `i`-th
coordinate of the gradient of the `(i,j)` entry.  The superposed competitor
carries a **defined** piecewise-constant gradient field
`superposedCompetitorSlope` (there is no single mesh whose Kuhn-slope operator
applies to the entry — that is exactly what denies), so
`superposedCompetitorDivergence` is defined by that distributed expression:

```
(∇·D̂_q)(x)_j = ∑_i (d − 1)⁻¹ ( q_j (∇ℓ̂_{e_i})(x)_i − q_i (∇ℓ̂_{e_j})(x)_i ) .
```

Two theorems show that this is the proved single-mesh construction and not a new one:
`competitorDivergence_eq_sum_entrywise` says the distributed expression at
single-mesh Kuhn slopes IS `CollarLayerEnvelopeG.competitorDivergence` (it is
`kuhnSlope_competitorAntisymDatum`, i.e. the unconditional linearity of
`kuhnSlope` in its datum, re-summed), and
`globalCompetitorDivergence_eq_competitorDivergence` says that at ONE component
— where a single mesh does govern — the distributed expression evaluated on
that component's own field is literally `competitorDivergence` at the root cell
containing the point.

## The normalization `∇·D_q = q`

`superposedCompetitorCellDivergence_sub_eq` is the exact algebraic identity

```
(∇·D̂_q)(𝔰)_j − q_j = (d−1)⁻¹ ( (∑_i (u_i)_i) q_j − ∑_i q_i (u_j)_i ) ,
u_i = ∇ℓ̂_{e_i}(𝔰) − e_i ,
```

the `d` of `∑_i (e_i)_i` and the `q_j` of `∑_i q_i (e_j)_i` cancelling against
the `(d−1)` of `e.dq` — this is the display `∇·D_q = q` in its cellwise form,
and `superposedCompetitorCellDivergence_eq_of_cellSlope_basisVec` is that
display itself: on a cell where the superposed basis slopes are the basis
vectors (clause 3 of `e.hat.linear.properties`, off the collar) the divergence
is exactly `q`.  It is the reason `hoffG` is a theorem here.

## The route to the layer envelope, and the constant

The `(2d−2)²`-cancellation core `vecNormSq_divergenceDeviation_le` of
`CollarLayerEnvelopeG` is reused verbatim: if every entry of the deviation
family `u` is at most `η`, then `|(∇·D̂_q)(𝔰) − q|² ≤ (2η)² |q|²`.  What feeds
it here is not the coordinatewise Step-2 estimate of the single-mesh branch (no
single mesh, hence no `kuhnSlope`-level bound) but the proved **summed
active-component envelope**, read at the `d` basis loads:

```
|∇ℓ̂_{e_i}(𝔰) − e_i|²  ≤  superposedGradConst d ² · 3^{2b(k+h_k)} · |e_i|²
```

(`SuperposedEnvelope.badFamily_vecNormSq_superposedCompetitorCellSlope_sub_le_layerEnvelope`
at `p := basisVec i`, with `|e_i|² = 1`), and a coordinate of a vector is at
most its Euclidean norm, so `η = superposedGradConst d · 3^{b(k+h_k)}` serves.

**The constant, itemized honestly.**  `2η` gives

```
superposedDivConst d = 2 · superposedGradConst d = 2 · M(d) · 648 d = 3888 d · 11^d ,
```

i.e. the summed gradient constant times **2**, and nothing else. A further factor of order
`d · |q|_{ℓ¹}` does **not** appear, for two reasons, both checkable in the proof: (i) the
`d` entries of the inner sum are priced through the proved local core, whose `(d−2)² +
2d(d−2) + d² = (2d−2)²` is exactly cancelled by the `(d−1)⁻¹` of `e.dq`, leaving the
factor `2` and not a factor `d`; and (ii) the `ℓ¹` size of the load never enters, because
the deviation bound fed into the core is an `ℓ^∞` bound obtained from the Euclidean
envelope at the **basis** loads (`|e_i|_{ℓ¹} = 1`), so the `ℓ¹ → ℓ²` conversion is already
inside `superposedGradConst d`.  The comparison with the single-mesh branch is the
expected one: there the `G`-leg constant equals the `F`-leg's `648 d` because the `F` leg
pays an extra `d` for a general slope `p`; here the `F`-leg constant `superposedGradConst
d` already contains that `d`, so the `G` leg is `2 ×` it.  Nothing is optimized, and no
random quantity, layer index or component enters the constant.

## Scope: what is NOT claimed

This module is the per-cell estimate and the three cell-constant clauses, only.

* **No divergence-freeness.**  `e.hat.D.bc`, `∇·D̂_q ∈ q + L²_{sol,0}(□_m)`, is
  **not** proved and is not implied by anything below.  is explicit that the
  parenthetical "(since `D̂_q` is antisymmetric)" carries the whole face-jump
  argument, and that it works only because `D̂_q ∈ W^{1,∞}`: for the
  superposition that needs the global continuity of the superposed `ℓ̂_{e_i}`,
  which needs local finiteness of the component family, which
  `GlobalSuperposition.lean` explicitly does not supply.  The `hG` leg of the
  composition therefore remains an O disclosed binder — but it is now stated at
  the right object.
* **No gradient identification.**  `superposedCompetitorSlope`, and hence
  `superposedCompetitorDivergence`, are *defined* piecewise-constant fields;
  nothing identifies either with a distributional gradient or divergence.
* **No new probabilistic input, no new geometry.**  The diameter datum, the
  window, the multiplicity bound `|𝒜_R| ≤ M(d)` and the cluster geometry are
  consumed only through the proved summed envelope; none is re-derived, and no
  overlap count occurs below.
