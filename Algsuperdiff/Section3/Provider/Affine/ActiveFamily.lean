# The active family `𝒜_R`, its multiplicity bound, and the superposed competitor

`GlobalSuperposition.lean` builds the multi-component competitor `ℓ̂_p = ℓ_p +
Σ_𝒞 (ℓ̂_p^𝒞 − ℓ_p)` and proves the three `sum_of_a_decomp` clauses for its
*field*, with **no** finiteness of the component family.  Its Scope section
names the gap that this module fills:

* **the active family is finite**, with a cardinality bounded by a dimensional
  constant `M(d)`, uniformly in the Whitney cube.

## The active family and the constant

For a Whitney cube `R` writes

> `𝒜_R := {𝒞 : R ∈ 𝒩(𝒞)}`

which is `activeComponents m hn ℐ R` below (the components of `ℐ` whose
touching collar contains `R`).  Here it is

```
M(d) = 3 · 11^d ,
```

`3` for the three layers `n−1, n, n+1` a cube touching a layer-`n` cube can
occupy (`BoundaryDistance.whitneyLayer_index_close_of_cubeTouch`, the adjacency
clause alone) and `11^d` for the per-layer packing at the **cubewise** touch
relation of `e.neighborhood.def`
(`Multiscale.CollarMass.card_le_eleven_pow_of_forall_cubeTouch`), the two
generations of scale slack being's `±2` depth window
(`Multiscale.CollarMass.layerDepth_sub_le_two`).

## Inactive components and the cell slope

The active family is what the superposed cell constants actually see.  The
Whitney cubes touching one Whitney cube form a finite family
(`finite_setOf_mem_whitneyPartition_cubeTouch`), each of them activating at most
`M(d)` components; and a component that is *inactive* at the Whitney cube `Q`
carrying a cell `T` — one whose touching collar misses `Q` — leaves the
competitor's cell constant on `T` equal to the ambient `p`, so it contributes
nothing to the sum of `superposedCompetitorCellSlope_eq_sum`.  That is
`globalCompetitorCellSlope_eq_of_notMem_activeComponents`, proved from the
predecessor's `globalCompetitorSlope_eq_cellSlope`.  Together with the
multiplicity bound it caps at `M(d)` the number of summands that can be nonzero
on any single cell.

## Scope: what this module does NOT do

* **No gradient estimate.**'s summed bound `|∇ℓ̂_p − p| ≤ C(d)|p| Σ_{𝒞 ∈ 𝒜_R}
  diam(𝒞)/ρ_𝒞` is **read and not consumed**: no diameter, no interpolation
  scale `ρ_𝒞` and no constant `C(d)` occurs below.  This module supplies the
  two inputs that estimate needs and nothing else — the finite index set `𝒜_R`
  over which the sum runs, and `|𝒜_R| ≤ M(d)` for the squared/Cauchy--Schwarz
  form.
* **No weak gradient, no `H¹₀`.**  The cell constants read below are those of
  the *defined* piecewise-constant field `superposedCompetitorCellSlope`, and
  nothing identifies them with a distributional gradient; no a.e. statement, no
  `MemVectorL2`, no `H10Function` and no zero-trace statement occurs.
  `e.hat.linear.1` and the `hF`/`hG` binders of `Multiscale.sum_of_a_decomp`
  remain untouched.
* **No continuity and no compact support.**  The counting below is confined to
  the **open** root cube, and that is sharp for this route: the Whitney cubes
  accumulate at `∂□_m`, so the finiteness argument has no analogue there.  As
  the predecessor recorded, compact support must come from the
  cutoff/truncation, not from the collar.
* **No disjointness of collars** is asserted or used, exactly as in
  `GlobalSuperposition.lean`; the overlap is counted, not removed.  Merging
  overlapping components is *not* attempted — rules it unsafe.
* **No three-layer window**  and no face-to-face property of `SW(□_m)`  is
  used.

## References

* ABK26, (`𝒲(□_m)`, `e.W.n.def`, the boundary distance), (`ℐ`,
  `e.neighborhood.def`), (the components), (the adjacency clause),
  (`e.SW.def`), (`l.piecewise.affine.approx`, `e.hat.linear.properties`), (the
  false disjointness), (Step 1, "well-defined and continuous"), (the gradient
  estimate — not consumed), (`ℓ_e`).
* Two ideas were taken: bound the touching cubes layerwise over `Icc (n-1)
  (n+1)` and sum the per-layer packing; and choose one bad cube per active
  component, recovering the component from it for injectivity.  Everything is
  restated at this repository's carriers (`CubeTouch`, `whitneyNeighborhood`,
  `badComponent`, `KuhnCell`, `globalCompetitor`) and reproved from this
  repository's proved inputs.

## Main results

* `card_le_three_mul_eleven_pow_of_forall_cubeTouch`,
  `finite_setOf_mem_whitneyPartition_cubeTouch` — the Whitney cubes touching one
  Whitney cube, counted and bounded.
* `activeComponents`, `activeComponents_finite`,
  `card_le_multiplicityBound_of_forall_mem_activeComponents` — **the deliverable
  `|𝒜_R| ≤ M(d) = 3·11^d`**, the bound being `multiplicityBound d = 3·11^d`.
* `globalCompetitorCellSlope_eq_of_notMem_activeComponents` — a component that
  is inactive at the Whitney cube of a cell leaves the competitor's slope on
  that cell equal to `p`.
