# The glued piecewise-affine function of `l.piecewise.affine.approx`

This module builds the function that Step 1 of ABK26's
`l.piecewise.affine.approx` constructs: "we prescribe the values at the
vertices and extend affinely to each simplex; since adjacent coarse simplices
share complete faces, this extension is well-defined and continuous".

`gluedKuhnAffine S g` is that function for a **finite equal-scale** family `S`
of Kuhn cells and a **global** vertex datum `g`.

* *equal scale.* rules **false** the printed inference that the final
  nonuniform family `SW(□_m)` is face-to-face; its Correction, and the
  clarifications/, prescribe instead that the values be prescribed and extended
  affinely on the **common coarse mesh**, which is a single-scale mesh, and
  only *then* restricted to the finer final cells.  The equal-scale hypothesis
  is exactly the hypothesis of the face-alignment lemma
  `closedCarrier_inter_subset_commonClosedFace` (`KuhnFaceAlignment.lean`),
  which is what makes the gluing well defined.  See the STOP note below for why
  no cross-scale variant of this definition is available.
* *finite.*  Local finiteness of the closed cells is what patches the per-cell
  continuity into continuity on the union
  (`LocallyFinite.continuousOn_iUnion`).  The common coarse mesh of a bounded
  Whitney-layer window is finite, which is the case needs; no statement below
  is about all of `SW(□_m)`, which is countably infinite.

## STOP: the cross-scale seam is not a gluing statement (recorded)

The obvious cross-scale generalization -- glue the per-cell interpolants
`kuhnInterp T g` over the *final* nonuniform family `SW(□_m)` -- is **not** the
manuscript's function and is **not** available from the proved inputs.  On a
final layer-`(j+1)` cell `T'` the manuscript's `ℓ̂_p` is the *coarse* affine
map of the common cell `U ⊇ T'`, whose values at the hanging vertices of `T'`
are "inherited from the coarse affine trace", **not** the prescribed datum `g`
at those points.

## Scope: what this module does NOT do

* No bad cube, component, neighborhood, layer or collar occurs; the mesh `S`
  and the datum `g` are arbitrary.  In particular nothing here assumes the
  neighborhoods of distinct components are disjoint  and no layer window is
  fixed.
* No `H¹` statement.
* No slope field of the glued function is defined here, and no identification
  of a piecewise-constant field with the distributional `∇ℓ̂_p` is proved or
  used.  What is proved is the cell-wise identification
  `gluedKuhnAffine_eqOn_closedCarrier`: on the closed carrier of each cell of
  the mesh the glued function *is* that cell's interpolant `kuhnInterp T g`,
  which is affine with the constant slope `kuhnSlope T g`.  That is the
  classical content of "`∇ℓ̂_p` is constant on each coarse simplex", read at
  the level of the function rather than of its gradient.
* is not consumed: no slope-square and no collar constant enters.

/-- **The piecewise-affine function of Step 1 of `l.piecewise.affine.approx`**: on
each cell of the mesh `S` it is that cell's affine interpolant of the global
vertex datum `g`, and away from the mesh it is the datum itself.

Well-definedness is *proved*, not assumed: two cells of one scale agree on the
overlap of their closed carriers
(`kuhnInterp_eqOn_closedCarrier_inter`), so the cell selected here is
immaterial.  See `gluedKuhnAffine_eqOn_closedCarrier`,
`gluedKuhnAffine_of_forall_notMem` and `existsUnique_gluedKuhnAffine` for the
