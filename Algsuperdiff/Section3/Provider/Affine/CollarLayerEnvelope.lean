# The collar layer envelope of `l.piecewise.affine.approx`

```
|∇ℓ̂_p − p|²  ≤  (648 d)² · 3^{2 b (k + h_k)} · |p|² ,
```

with the constant **explicit and dimension-only**.  This is exactly the shape
of the `hF`/`hG` binders of `Multiscale.LayerUniform.bounds_on_slopes_when_bad`
and of `…collar_whitneySimplexCells_le_ae`, i.e. the collar A antecedent those
consumers carry as a hypothesis; `Cgrad = 648 d` is the value supplied by this
local Provider result.

## The route

1. `CompetitorVertexData` gives the per-cell estimate `|∇ℓ̂_p − p|² ≤ d · (2
   |p|_{ℓ¹} D / 3^{scale})²`, where `D` bounds the diameter of *every*
   component active at the cell's Whitney cube.
2. The proved local cluster geometry supplies `D`.  Its finiteness — the
   analytic admissibility of `⨍_{𝒞}` — comes from the same node's
   `whitneyNeighborhood_finite_and_mem_leastLayer_or_succ`.
3. The whole scale step is the hypothesis-minimal core (de-privatized)
   `four_mul_three_rpow_layer_envelope_le`, which is the only place `rpow`
   occurs.
4. `l + h_l ≤ k + h_k` turns `3^{b(l+h_l)}` into `3^{b(k+h_k)}`, and
   `(∑_i |p_i|)² ≤ d |p|²` (`sq_vecNormOne_le`) turns the `ℓ¹` size of the
   slope into its Euclidean square.  The constant is
   `4 · d · d · (4 · 81)² = (648 d)²`.

## The constant, itemized

Nothing is optimized; the point is that no random quantity, no layer index and
no component enters.

## No overlap count is consumed

Under the single-assignment vertex datum of `CompetitorVertexData` each vertex
is claimed by exactly one component, so the per-cell deviation is the *max*
over `𝒜_R`, which is bounded by the same layerwise envelope with no cardinality
input: the binder `hact` of `…_sub_le_of_forall_touching` ranges over exactly
`𝒜_R` and demands the bound for each of its members.
`Multiscale.CollarMass.card_le_eleven_pow_of_forall_cubeTouch` is therefore
**not used** here; it remains the instrument for the superposition
presentation, where the corrections genuinely add.

## Scope

No global function is constructed and no continuity, `H¹` membership or
subordination is claimed (see the scope section of `CompetitorVertexData`).
The statement is per cell, which is the level at which
`e.hat.linear.properties` states its gradient estimate  and the level
`Multiscale.sum_of_a_decomp` (SubadditiveDecomposition.lean) consumes.  No
layer window is assumed: the layer bookkeeping used here is the *proved*
`l.bad.clusters.geometry`, whose neighborhood conclusion is proved, not
hypothesized.

/-! ## The scale core -/

/-- **The scale step of the layer envelope**, isolated from every geometric and
measure-theoretic input so that `rpow` occurs in exactly one place.  With
`a = l + h_l` the depth of the diameter bound's anchor layer, `q = k + h_k` the
depth of the cell's own layer and `c = (k+1) + h_{k+1}` the depth of the cell
side, the two hypotheses `a ≤ q` and `c ≤ a + 4` convert the cluster diameter
bound into the layer envelope at the cost of `3⁴`. -/

/-! ## The active-component diameter datum -/

/-- **Every component active at a layer-`k` Whitney cube is finite and has the
layer-`k` cluster diameter.**  This is `l.bad.clusters.geometry` read at the
active family `𝒜_□ = {𝒞 : □ ∈ 𝒩(𝒞)}`: a bad cube touching `□` puts `□` in its
component's neighborhood, so that neighborhood meets layer `k` and the proved
diameter bound applies to it, hence to the component it contains.  Finiteness
is the same node's neighborhood finiteness, and is what makes `⨍_{𝒞} ℓ_p` an
honest average. -/
