# The common coarse mesh and the competitor on it

This module provides a proved local implementation of the **corrected Step 1**
construction associated with ABK26's `l.piecewise.affine.approx`, in the form
prescribed:

> Let `j` be the least layer occupied by the **neighborhood**.  Then
> `𝒩(𝒞) ⊆ 𝒲(□_m, j) ∪ 𝒲(□_m, j+1)`.  The target-`j` common mesh is exactly the
> final `e.SW.def` mesh on layer `j`.  On layer `j+1`, the printed final mesh
> refines that common coarse mesh.  Hence one may prescribe values and extend
> affinely on the common coarse mesh, then restrict the affine maps to the
> deeper final simplices.  The restriction remains affine, continuous, and
> subordinate to the printed `SW(□_m)`.

`commonCoarseMesh N s` is that mesh: every cube of the window `N` triangulated
at the single scale `s`.

## Scope: what this module does NOT do

* **The two-layer window is a hypothesis here, not a theorem.**  Every
  statement takes the window `N` and the layer bound as explicit binders; the
  fact that the *actual* touching neighborhood `𝒩(𝒞)` occupies at most two
  consecutive layers -- the second "small point" -- is a statement about
  `l.bad.clusters.geometry`, is not proved here, and is not assumed anywhere
  below in disguise: nothing in this file mentions `𝒩(𝒞)`.
* **No global assembly.**  The competitor is built on *one* window.  Assembling
  the per-component window competitors into a single global `ℓ̂_p` on `□_m`
  still requires handling the overlap (neighborhoods of distinct components are
  **not** disjoint) and the matching of each window competitor with `ℓ_p`
  across the outer boundary of its window.  Neither is proved here or anywhere
  in this repository.
* **No `H¹` statement.**  `e.hat.linear.1` (label and content) and the
  `hF`/`hG` binders of `sum_of_a_decomp` require an `H10Function` witness and
  an `L²` weak gradient; see the scope section of `GlobalGluing.lean`.
* /`-c1` are not consumed: no gradient estimate, no collar constant and no
  component diameter occurs here.
