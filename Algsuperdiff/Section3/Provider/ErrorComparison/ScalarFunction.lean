# Provider: the scalar function `f(x) = x⁻¹ (x-1)²`

This file isolates, over abstract reals, the scalar analysis used in the proof
of the second inequality of `e.bound.Lambdas.by.Es` in ABK26.

The printed proof introduces `f(x) := x^{-1}(x-1)^2`, observes that `f` is the
eigenvalue function of the operator inequalities
`e.xminusonetimesxminusonesquared.sstar` and
`e.xminusonetimesxminusonesquared.b`, and then uses the two elementary facts

> for every `δ, ε > 0`, `f(x) ≤ δ` implies `x - 1 ≤ δ + δ^{1/2} ≤ (1+ε^{-1})δ +
> (1/4)ε`

together with the optimization in `ε` performed afterwards.

Everything here is stated for real numbers only; no matrix, cube or coefficient
data appears.

## Main results

* `invMulSubOneSq_le_add_sub_two`: the two-sided pairing `f(x) ≤ x + y - 2`
  whenever `1 ≤ x * y`, which is how the printed operator inequalities are used
  at the level of quadratic forms;
* `sub_one_le_add_sqrt_of_invMulSubOneSq_le`: `f(x) ≤ δ → x - 1 ≤ δ + δ^{1/2}`;
* `sqrt_le_inv_mul_add_quarter`: `δ^{1/2} ≤ ε⁻¹ δ + ε/4`;
* `le_one_add_of_invMulSubOneSq_le`: the combined `ε`-linearized bound
  `f(x) ≤ δ → x ≤ 1 + (1 + ε⁻¹) δ + ε/4`;
* `le_add_sqrt_two_mul_of_forall_pos`: the optimization in `ε`.

This is the scalar shadow of the printed operator inequalities: the quadratic
forms of the two normalized coarse matrices always have product at least one,
and their sum minus `2` therefore dominates `f` of either one. -/
