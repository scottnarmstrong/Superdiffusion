# Provider: the volume-averaged doubled coefficient matrix

The chain `e.CG.bounds.2` in ABK26,

`(⨍_U bfA⁻¹(x) dx)⁻¹ ≤ bfA_*(U) ≤ bfA(U) ≤ ⨍_U bfA(x) dx`,

compares the coarse block matrices with volume averages of the pointwise
doubled coefficient field.  CoarseGraining names the pointwise field
`Homogenization.Book.Ch02.blockMatrixField` and its pointwise inverse
`Homogenization.Book.Ch02.blockMatrixInverseField`, but has no averaged block
matrix; this file introduces them, following the `averageMat` conventions of
`Homogenization/Book/Ch02/Matrices.lean`.

The analytic content of the file is the exchange of the volume average with the
doubled quadratic form,

`⨍_U X ⬝ bfA(x) X dx = X ⬝ (⨍_U bfA(x) dx) X`,

which needs integrability of the `2d × 2d` entries of `bfA(x)` on `U`.  That is
discharged entirely from the `CoeffOn` carrier: `CoeffOn.aeElliptic` gives a.e.
ellipticity of the representative on `U`, which bounds every doubled entry by
`Real.sqrt (blockMatrixOfCoeffNormSqBound lam Lam)`, and the pointwise-good
representative `Internal.Ch02.BookCh02.pointwiseCoeffOn` supplies a genuinely
measurable coefficient field a.e. equal to `a`, whence a.e. strong measurability
of the doubled entries.  Chapter 2 domains carry finite volume, so bounded plus
a.e. strongly measurable is integrable.

/-! ### The pointwise inverse field really is the pointwise inverse

`blockMatrixInverseField` is *defined* as an explicit block formula, so its
name alone does not certify that it inverts `blockMatrixField`.  The two lemmas
below record the genuine two-sided identification, a.e. on the Chapter 2
domain, from `CoeffOn.aeElliptic` and CoarseGraining's pointwise block Fenchel
inverse identity
`Homogenization.blockMatMul_blockReflect_blockMatrixOfCoeff_eq_id`.  They
document the left-hand term `⨍_U bfA⁻¹(x) dx` of `e.CG.bounds.2` as the average
of the genuine pointwise inverse. -/
