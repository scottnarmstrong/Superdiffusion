# Provider: the averaged block chain `e.CG.bounds.2`

This file proves a local version of the right-hand inequality of the display
`e.CG.bounds.2` in ABK26,

`(⨍_U bfA⁻¹(x) dx)⁻¹ ≤ bfA_*(U) ≤ bfA(U) ≤ ⨍_U bfA(x) dx`,

for an admissible block coefficient field on a Chapter 2 domain, in the doubled
Loewner order `Homogenization.BlockMatLoewnerLE`.

The inequality is proved by the variational route of the notes, and is
accompanied by the order isomorphism that turns it into the left-hand bound.

* **Right, `bfA(U) ≤ ⨍_U bfA`.**  The constant doubled field `x ↦ P` is
  admissible for the doubled `mu` problem at load `P` (its fluctuation is zero),
  so the minimum `mu(U,P)` is at most the energy of that competitor, which is
  `½ P ⬝ (⨍_U bfA) P` by
  `average_blockEnergyDensityAt`.  On the other side
  `Book.Ch02.DoubledMuTheory.mu_quadratic` identifies `mu(U,P) = ½ P ⬝ bfA(U) P`.

* **Reflection.**  In the doubled formalism the pointwise inverse is the block
  reflection, `bfA⁻¹(x) = blockReflect (bfA(x))`, exactly as
  `bfA_*⁻¹(U) = blockReflect (bfA(U))` at the coarse level.  Reflection is an
  order isomorphism for the doubled Loewner order
  (`blockMatLoewnerLE_blockReflect`), so the dual form of the left-hand bound —
  `bfA_*⁻¹(U) ≤ ⨍_U bfA⁻¹(x) dx`, the form that does not invert a matrix — is
  the block reflection of the right-hand bound.
