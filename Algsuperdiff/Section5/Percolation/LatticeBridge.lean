# Two readings of a crossing of the annulus `□_k → □_{k+1}^c`

A crossing of the lattice annulus is written in two ways in this development.

* As a **function** `x : ℕ → Fin d → ℤ` together with a length `N`, with
  consecutive sites at sup distance at most one (`IsLatticePath`), starting in
  the cube `□_k` and ending outside `□_{k+1}`.  This is the reading of the
  source: a step may stay put, so a site may be repeated.
* As a **list** `Γ : List (Fin d → ℤ)` of strictly adjacent sites with the same
  endpoint conditions (`IsPathFrom k`).  This is the reading of the percolation
  path estimate.

The two readings describe the same crossings once the count attached to a
crossing is a count of *distinct sites*: deleting the repetitions of a
functional crossing changes neither its endpoints nor its set of sites.  This
file proves that equivalence, and records the geometric consequence that a
crossing visits at least `3 ^ k + 2` distinct sites.

## Main definitions

* `pathSites N x` — the set of sites visited by `x` on `{0, …, N}`.

## Main results

* `exists_isPathFrom_of_isLatticePath`, `exists_isLatticePath_of_isPathFrom` —
  the two directions of the translation, each preserving the set of sites.
* `exists_crossing_iff` — the resulting equivalence for any property of the set
  of sites.

## References

* ABK26, the percolation estimate for bad cubes.
