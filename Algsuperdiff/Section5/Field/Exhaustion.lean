# A spatial exhaustion function for the stream field

The reciprocal affine norm gives a positive, one-Lipschitz exhaustion of
`Vec d`.  Its compact superlevel sets control escape to spatial infinity.  A
radius amplification records the extra Euclidean separation forced when a
distant point remains in a sufficiently high exhaustion superlevel set.

## Main definitions

* `streamExhaustionRho` — the exhaustion `(1 + ‖x‖)⁻¹`.
* `streamExhaustionAmp` — the amplified radius used by spatial tail bounds.
