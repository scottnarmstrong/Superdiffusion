# First moments of the two tail gauges

The two legs of the quantitative tail condition of `TailGauge.lean` are
controlled in the mean by the two proved shell displays of the assumptions:

* the descending value gauge `‖j_{ℓ-r}‖_{L^∞(□_ℓ)}` has the one-shell scaling
  law of `(J2)`, whose first moment on the cube `□_ℓ` is of order
  `3^{γ(ℓ-r)} (1+r)^{1/2}`, the profile `cubeMajorant`;
* the ascending volume-normalized gradient gauge
  `‖∇ j_{ℓ+r}‖_{W̲^{1,∞}(y+□_ℓ)}` has a `Γ₂` upper tail at the amplitude
  `3^{-ℓ} 3^{(γ-1)(ℓ+r)}` of `e.nabla.jk.O`, so its first moment is at most a
  constant multiple of that amplitude.

Weighing the first by `3^{-ℓ}` and the second by `3^{ℓ}` makes both profiles
proportional to `(3^{γ-1})^{ℓ}`, which is summable because `γ ≤ 1/4`.
