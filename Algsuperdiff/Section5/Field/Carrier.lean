# The sample carrier of the full stream matrix

`Algsuperdiff.Section3.Cutoff.CutoffSample` carries exactly the descending
convergence needed by the lower-infinite cutoffs `k_m = Σ_{n ≤ m} j_n`.  The
full normalized field `k(x) = Σ_{n ∈ ℤ} (j_n(x) - j_n(0))` needs the ascending
half as well, and needs it quantitatively, since the size of `k` on a cube of
scale `ℓ` is governed by the two tails at that scale.

This module adds the two ascending conditions to that carrier and builds the
resulting sample space and its law.  The carrier is the event itself: no value
is assigned off it, and every statement about the field is a statement on the
carrier.

## Main definitions

* `FullTailGood γ ω` — lower-tail goodness, the sharp two-sided rates, and the
  ascending gradient condition on the countable family of cubes `y + □_n` with
  `y` rational.
* `FullSample d γ` — the subtype of `CutoffSample d` cut out by `FullTailGood γ`.
* `fullSampleLaw M` — the induced probability law.

## Main results

* `measurableSet_fullTailGood`, `ae_fullTailGood` — the event is measurable and
  has full probability.
* `map_fullSampleLaw_val` — pushing the law forward recovers the cutoff-sample
  law, so every cutoff statement transports to the new carrier.

## References

* ABK26, the stream matrix and its scale decomposition.

/-- **The full-tail event.**  Lower-tail goodness is already carried by the
ambient `CutoffSample`; this adds the ascending half in two forms.

The sharp conjunct gives one sample constant for the two pointwise shell rates
at every shell/cube crossover.  For an admissible model exponent those rates
imply the former quantitative two-leg growth condition.

The final conjunct is the ascending gradient condition on the countable family
of cubes `y + □_n` with rational centres.  It supplies local summability for the
field at an arbitrary exponent and is also the bridge to the
Section 5.1 large-scale event: it is that event on the same cubes, written with
bounded partial sums instead of a threshold, and
`exists_mem_largeScaleEvent_of_upperGradBounded` turns it into membership of
`Algsuperdiff.Section5.Support.largeScaleEvent` at a finite threshold, the form
the large-scale estimates consume.  It is carried on the field's carrier so
that the field and those estimates speak about one and the same sample. -/
