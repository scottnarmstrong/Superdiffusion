# The percolation path bound on the paper lattice

The paper indexes its cube events by `3^(n-1) ℤ^d`.  This file embeds that
lattice in `Vec d`, identifies its centered crossing annulus with
`Percolation.IsPathFrom (m-n)`, and restates `Percolation.path_bound` with
events evaluated at the physical lattice points.

Throughout Section 5, both path adjacency and spatial separation are measured
in the `ℓ∞` metric.  The equivalence below makes this explicit:
lattice site distance at most `L` is the same as physical sup distance at most
`L * 3^(n-1)`.
