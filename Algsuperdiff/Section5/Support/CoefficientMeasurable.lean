# The coefficient field is a measurable map into the continuous fields on a compact set

On a compact set `K` the cutoff coefficient field `a_m(ω) = ν I + k_m(ω)` is a
continuous matrix field, and the assignment `ω ↦ a_m(ω)|_K` is measurable into
the Banach space `C(K, Mat d)` of continuous matrix fields with the supremum
norm.

The proof uses no separability argument and no dense evaluation criterion.  Each
shell of the sample is, by construction, a bundled continuous map, and
restriction to `K` is continuous for the compact-open topologies, so every finite
partial sum of shells is a *continuous* image of finitely many coordinates of
the sample and is therefore measurable.  The lower-tail control makes the partial
sums converge uniformly on every centred cube, hence in `C(K, Mat d)`, and a
pointwise limit of measurable maps into a metrizable Borel space is measurable.

## Main definitions

* `cutoffCoeffMap nu m omega` — the coefficient field as a continuous matrix
  field on `ℝ^d`.
* `coefficientCutoffRestrict nu m K omega` — its restriction to `K`.

## Main results

* `measurable_coefficientCutoffRestrict` — the assignment is measurable.

## References

* ABK26, the cutoff coefficient field of Section 3.

/-! ## Instance caches for `Mat d`

Mathlib v4.33 assembles the scoped elementwise matrix norm with
`fast_instance%`, so the topology reachable from `Matrix.normedAddCommGroup`
is a flattened copy of the product topology and no longer *syntactically*
the one bare `Mat d` carries by default (the plain, unconditional
`TopologicalSpace (Matrix m n R) := inferInstanceAs (TopologicalSpace (m → n
→ R))` bridging instance). `SecondCountableTopology`/`PseudoMetrizableSpace`
have no dedicated `Matrix`-level bridging instance at all, so blind search
for them on `Mat d` fails outright. Both are supplied here, pinned to the
same `Fin d → Fin d → ℝ` spelling the bridging `TopologicalSpace` instance
already uses, so `inferInstanceAs` closes by unfolding the `Matrix` type
synonym rather than by a fresh (and now-failing) search. -/
