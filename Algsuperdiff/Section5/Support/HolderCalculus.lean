# Calculus of the supremum norm and the Hölder seminorm

This file retains two explicit two-point estimates: interpolation of a Hölder
bound between a supremum bound and a Lipschitz bound,

  ```text
    [F]_{C^{0,1/2}(U)} ≤ ( 2 ‖F‖_{L^∞(U)} · L )^{1/2} ,
  ```

and the Leibniz estimate for a scalar multiple in explicit
`HolderSeminormBoundOn` form.

/-! ## 2. Interpolation between the supremum norm and a Lipschitz bound -/

/-- **Interpolation of the `1/2`-Hölder seminorm.**  A field bounded by `S` on
`U` and Lipschitz there with constant `L` has `1/2`-Hölder seminorm at most
`(2 S L)^{1/2}`: the two bounds `‖F x - F z‖ ≤ 2S` and `‖F x - F z‖ ≤ L‖x - z‖`
multiply, and the square root of their product is the stated bound.

No sign hypothesis is needed: at two distinct points of `U` the two hypotheses
force `0 ≤ S` and `0 ≤ L`, and at a single point both sides vanish. -/
