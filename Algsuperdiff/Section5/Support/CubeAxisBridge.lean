# The translated triadic cube as an axis cube

The localized Dirichlet problems are indexed by the translated triadic cube
`cubeSetAt y n`, the open cube of side `3 ^ n` centred at `y`, while the
boundary regularity theory is stated for the axis cube `axisCube z L`, the
open box `z + (0, L) ^ d`.  The two carriers agree once the centre is
converted into the lower corner.

The other hypothesis the variational theory asks of this carrier,
`IsOpenBoundedConvexDomain (cubeSetAt y n)`, is already available as
`isOpenBoundedConvexDomain_cubeSetAt`; it is recorded here as the sole
remaining geometric input of the whole-space comparison on a triadic cube.
