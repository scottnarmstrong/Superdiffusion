# Monotonicity of the good cube event in its two parameters

The percolation estimate counts the sites at which the event

```text
  Q(z + □_n, ε) = 𝒢(z + □_n, ε) ∩ 𝒥(z + □_n, C⁻¹ ε γ^{-1/2})
```

occurs, and the exit-time comparison on a good cube is stated on the same
event with its own constant in place of `C`.  The two therefore speak the same
event as soon as the two constants agree, and where they do not agree the
inclusions of this file convert one into the other: the event grows with the
accuracy `ε` and shrinks as the constant `C` grows, because `C` enters only
through the threshold `C⁻¹ ε γ^{-1/2}` of the large-scale event.

The consequence used downstream is the rescaling of the accuracy: replacing
`ε` by `ε / max 1 C` turns the event formed with the constant `1` into the
event formed with the constant `C`, at every centre and every scale.

/-- **The accuracy rescaling.**  Dividing the accuracy by `max 1 C` turns the
event formed with the constant `1` into the event formed with the constant
`C`; both halves only improve, since `ε / max 1 C ≤ ε` and
`ε / max 1 C ≤ C⁻¹ ε`. -/
