# Every class of continuous forcing fields on the closed cube has a countable dense subclass

The forcing fields of Section 5.1 are continuous on the closed cube, so they are
points of `C(closedCubeAt y n, Vec d)`.  That space is second countable — the
closed cube is a compact second-countable locally compact space and `Vec d` is
second countable — and second countability is inherited by every subspace, so
**every** class of such fields, in particular the normalized one, has a
countable subclass dense in it for the supremum distance.  No compactness and no
Arzelà–Ascoli argument is needed.

## Main definitions

* `extendVec y n G` — the field on `ℝ^d` determined by a continuous field on the
  closed cube, through the coordinatewise retraction.

## References

* ABK26, the localized error and regularity quantities of Section 5.1.
