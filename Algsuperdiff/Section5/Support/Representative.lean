# Continuous representatives on the cube `y + □_n`

The Section 5 error and regularity quantities measure a solution in the
supremum norm and in the `1/2`-Hölder seminorm, both taken **pointwise** on
`y + □_n`.  An `H¹` witness is only determined away from a null set, so those
quantities are attached not to the witness but to a continuous representative of
it.  This module names that datum and proves that it is unique where it is
asserted.

## Main definitions

* `HasCubeContinuousRepresentativeAt y n u` — the `H¹` witness `u` has an
  everywhere-defined representative that agrees with it away from a null set and
  is continuous on `y + □_n`.

## Main results

* `eqOn_of_ae_eq_of_continuousOn` — on an open set, two functions that agree away
  from a null set and are continuous there agree at every point.
* `hasCubeContinuousRepresentativeAt_unique` — any two representatives of the
  same witness agree at every point of `y + □_n`.

## References

* ABK26, the localized error and regularity quantities of Section 5.1.

/-! ## 2. The representative datum on `y + □_n` -/

/-- **`u` has a representative continuous on `y + □_n`.**

This is the datum the Section 5 regularity quantity needs in order to measure
`u` in the `1/2`-Hölder seminorm at every point of the cube, not merely away
from a null set.  No finiteness of that seminorm is required: where the source
takes the seminorm of the continuous representative, an infinite value is a
legitimate value and must be recorded as such. -/

/-- **The representative is unique on the cube.**  Two representatives of the
same `H¹` witness agree at every point of `y + □_n`, so every pointwise quantity
built from one of them is independent of the choice. -/
