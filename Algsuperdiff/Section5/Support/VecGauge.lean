# Elementary gauges and matrix algebra on the ambient vector carrier

The Section 5 modules work with two sizes of a vector of `Vec d = Fin d → ℝ`:
the ambient supremum norm `‖v‖` that the carrier itself carries, and the
Euclidean size `vecNorm v` in which the shell derivative gauges are written.
This leaf collects the two facts about that carrier that several Section 5
modules need and that would otherwise be reproved in each of them:

* the homogeneity of the Euclidean size, and its comparison
  `vecNorm v ≤ √d ‖v‖` with the ambient one, which is where every dimensional
  constant of the perturbation estimates comes from;
* the compatibility of the matrix action with a finite sum of vectors.

Both are stated for the plain carrier, with no model, cube or shell data, so the
module sits below every other Section 5 support file.

## Main results

* `vecNorm_smul` — absolute homogeneity of the Euclidean size.
* `vecNorm_le_sqrt_dim_mul_norm` — the Euclidean size is at most `√d` times the
  ambient supremum norm.
* `matVecMul_finset_sum` — a fixed matrix commutes with a finite sum of vectors.
