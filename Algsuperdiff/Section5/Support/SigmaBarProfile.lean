# The running diffusivity against the effective diffusivity profile

The running diffusivity `σ̄_n` of the coefficient cutoff at scale `n` lies
within the relative distance `C γ^{1/2} |log γ|` of the effective diffusivity
profile

```text
  ν_eff(3^n) = (ν² + c⋆ γ⁻¹ 3^{2γn})^{1/2} ,
```

for every scale `n`, with a constant `C = C(d) c⋆^{-2}`.  This is the induction
estimate for the running diffusivity of Section 3, read at a triadic scale
through `effectiveDiffusivity_three_zpow`.

The amplitude `γ^{1/2}|log γ|` tends to `0` with `γ`, so the relative distance
is at most `1/2` as soon as the disorder parameter lies below an explicit
threshold.  Both halves are packaged together here, which turns the two
comparisons of `LengthTimeScale` between

```text
  T(3^n) = 3^{2n} ν_eff(3^n)⁻¹    and    exitTimeScale M n = 3^{2n} σ̄_n⁻¹
```

into statements with no remaining premise beyond the threshold on `γ`.

## Main results

* `exists_sqrt_mul_abs_log_le` — any multiple of the amplitude
  `γ^{1/2}|log γ|` is below any prescribed positive bound once `γ` is below an
  explicit threshold.
* `exists_sigmaBar_close_to_effectiveDiffusivity` — the relative bound between
  the running diffusivity and the profile, at every triadic scale, together
  with the smallness of its amplitude.
* `exists_lengthTimeScale_conversions` — the resulting comparison of the two
  time scales, with the explicit factors `2` and `3/2`.

## References

* ABK26, the induction bounds for the running diffusivity of Section 3, and
  the time scale of a length scale of Section 5.3.

/-! ## 1. The disorder threshold -/

/-- **The amplitude `γ^{1/2}|log γ| ` is uniformly small for small disorder.**
For every positive multiplier `K` and every prescribed positive bound `eps`
there is a threshold below which `K γ^{1/2}|log γ| ≤ eps`.

The threshold is explicit: with `A = max 1 (4 K / eps)` it is `A⁻⁴`, because
`γ^{1/2}|log γ| ≤ 4 γ^{1/4}`. -/

/-! ## 2. The running diffusivity against the profile -/

/-- **The running diffusivity is within a small relative distance of the
effective diffusivity profile.**  For a fixed value `c⋆` of the disorder
strength there are a threshold `γ₀` and a constant `C` such that every model
with that disorder strength and with `γ ≤ γ₀` satisfies both

```text
  C γ^{1/2}|log γ| ≤ 1/2
```

and, at every triadic scale `3^n`,

```text
  |σ̄_n − ν_eff(3^n)| ≤ C γ^{1/2}|log γ| σ̄_n .
```

The constant is `C = C(d) c⋆^{-2}` and the threshold is the smaller of the
disorder threshold of the induction estimate and the threshold that makes the
amplitude at most `1/2`. -/
