# Reading the cube geometry inside a larger carrier

The hit-then-exit chaining estimate is stated for a process of the state space in which the cubes
live.  The process produced by the divergence-form chain is a process of a larger carrier, the
state space being read inside it by an open embedding.  This file supplies the two deterministic
ingredients needed to move the chaining input across that reading.

The first is a corestriction: a continuous path of the larger carrier all of whose values are
images is the image of a continuous path of the state space.  Only the fact that the reading is a
topological embedding is used, through `Topology.IsEmbedding.continuous_iff`.

The second is the geometry of the padded cube families read inside the carrier.  The padded closed
cells are compact, so their images are compact and their union is closed; the padded enlargements
are open, so their images are open; and the overlap count is unchanged because the reading is
injective.

## Main results

* `exists_pathPostcomp_eq_of_forall_mem_range` — the corestriction of a path with image values.
* `exists_pathPostcomp_eq_of_exitTime_range_eq_top` — the same from an infinite exit time from the
  image of the state space.
* `isClosed_iUnion_image_enumeratedClosedCubeFamily`,
  `isOpen_image_enumeratedOpenEnlargementFamily`, `image_enumeratedCubeFamily_overlap` — the
  hypotheses of the chaining estimate for the read families.
