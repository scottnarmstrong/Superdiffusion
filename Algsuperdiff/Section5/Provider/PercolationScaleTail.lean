# The union bound over scales for the percolation scale

The percolation estimate of Section 5.2 produces, at every scale `k`, a bound
`P[light crossing at scale k] ≤ exp(-A 3^k)` with a rate `A` independent of `k`.
This file turns a family of such bounds into the two statements the
chains-of-good-cubes proposition needs:

* the light crossings stop occurring almost surely, so the percolation scale
  `percolationScaleTotal` is almost surely given by its defining property; and
* the tail `P[Y ≥ N] ≤ exp(-(A/6) 3^N)` for every `N ≥ 1`.

Both come from the same elementary observation: because `3^i ≥ 1 + 2i`, the
sequence `exp(-u 3^i)` is dominated by the geometric sequence
`exp(-u) exp(-2u)^i`, whose sum is at most `2 exp(-u)` as soon as
`exp(-2u) ≤ 1/2`.  Summing from the scale `N - 1` — the first scale at which the
defining property of the percolation scale can fail when `Y ≥ N` — gives
`2 exp(-A 3^{N-1})`, and the second factor of `2` is absorbed into the exponent
by lowering the rate from `A/3` to `A/6`.  The clause is stated for `N ≥ 1`: at
`N = 0` the left-hand side is `1` and no positive rate can bound it.

## Main results

* `tsum_exp_mul_three_pow_le` — the geometric domination of `exp(-u 3^i)`.
* `measure_iUnion_shift_le` — the union bound from the scale `j` upwards.
* `ae_mem_eventuallyHeavyPaths` — the light crossings stop almost surely.
* `measure_le_percolationScaleTotal_le` — the tail of the percolation scale.
