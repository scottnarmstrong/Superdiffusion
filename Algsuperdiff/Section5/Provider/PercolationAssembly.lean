# The crossing bridge for the chains of good cubes

Section 5.2 asserts that, for every maximal scale `m`, there is an integer-valued
random variable `Y_m` with an exponential tail such that below the scale
`m - Y_m` every rescaled lattice path crossing the annulus between the cubes
`□_{m-n}` and `□_{m-n+1}` meets the good event `Q(z + □_n, ε)` at at least
three quarters of `3^{m-n}` of its sites.

One step of that argument is recorded here: the passage from a crossing that is
light for the good event `Q` to a crossing that is light for the site-indexed
family `shiftedSiteBadEventFive`, the family the abstract percolation path
estimate is applied to.  The complement of a bad site is contained in `Q`, so a
path visiting few sites of `Q` visits few complements of bad sites, and the
count the path estimate controls bounds `qSiteCount` from below.

## Main results

* `lightQPathEvent_subset` — a light crossing of the annulus is a light crossing
  for the site-indexed family.

* ABK26, the chains of good cubes of Section 5.2.

/-- **A light crossing of the annulus is a light crossing for the site family.**
The complement of the union over scales of the bad events at a site is contained
in `Q` at that site, so the good-vertex count of the percolation estimate is at
most the count of sites at which `Q` occurs.  The two readings of a crossing —
as a function on an initial segment and as a list of adjacent sites — are
identified by `exists_crossing_iff`, which carries the set of visited sites
across unchanged. -/
