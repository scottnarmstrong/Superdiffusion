# The contraction factor and the site embedding of the one-step Laplace estimate

The one-step estimate on a good cube produces, at one centre, a strict
contraction for the negative exponential of the exit time from the enlarged
cube.  Its discount rate is `(C T(3^n))⁻¹` and its factor is
`oneStepLaplaceContraction` at the two scale constants of the exit-time
comparison, and neither depends on the centre of the cell, on the direction of
the datum, or on the sample: the constant `C` of the exit-time comparison is
returned once and for all, before the model, the accuracy, the scale and the
centre are quantified.

## The two indexings

The cells are the closed scale-`(n-1)` cells `z + □̄_{n-1}` centred at the
embedded lattice sites `3^{n-1} z`, and the enlargements are the open cubes
`z + □_n`.  The one-step estimate speaks of the pair
`(closure (y + □_{n-1}), y + □_n)`, so the two agree once the site embedding
`rescaledLatticePoint n` is recognized as `rescaleSite (n - 1)`.

## Main results

* `oneStepLaplaceContraction_ne_top`, `oneStepLaplaceContraction_lt_one` — the
  contraction factor is finite and strictly below one.
* `rescaledLatticePoint_eq_rescaleSite`, `good_goodSiteEnum` — the site
  embedding of the two indexings above, and the goodness of an enumerated site.
