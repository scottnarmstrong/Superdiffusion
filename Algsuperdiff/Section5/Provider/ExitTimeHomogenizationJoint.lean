# The expected exit time from a good cube

For a bounded domain `U` the expected exit time `w(x) = E_x[τ(U)]` of the
diffusion is the solution of the Dirichlet problem `-∇·a∇w = 1` in `U`,
`w = 0` on `∂U`.  On the good cube event that problem was already compared, at
the linear datum `g(x) = x_i e_i` whose divergence is the constant one, with
the homogenized profile `w̃` of `-σ̄_n Δ w̃ = 1`: the rough-field solution is
bounded by `C T(3^n)` on the whole cube and is at least half the homogenized
profile on the inner cube `y + □_{n-1}`, while the homogenized profile itself
is at least `T(3^n)/C` there.

Combining the two gives the two exit-time estimates of the early-exit bound: a
uniform upper bound for the expected exit time on the cube and a uniform lower
bound on the inner cube, both at the scale `T(3^n) = 3^{2n}/σ̄_n`.

The value `w` of the expected exit time enters through the hypothesis
`hident`, which says that `w` is the extended-real reading of the continuous
representative of the Dirichlet solution at every point of the cube.  That is
the identification of the expected exit time with the solution of the Dirichlet
problem; it is named here rather than assumed silently, and it is supplied for
the process of a coefficient field by the whole-space exit-time identity.

## Main results

* `exit_time_bounds_on_good_cube` — the uniform upper bound on the cube and the
  uniform lower bound on the inner cube.

/-- **The expected exit time from a good cube.**  Let `w` be a function on the
cube identified, through `hident`, with the continuous representative of the
Dirichlet solution of `-∇·a_m∇u = 1` on `y + □_n` with zero boundary values.
On the good cube event `Q(y + □_n, ε)` at the constant returned here, `w` is at
most `C T(3^n)` at every point of the cube, and, once `ε` is below the
threshold `c`, at least `C⁻¹ T(3^n)` at every point of the inner cube
`y + □_{n-1}`. -/
