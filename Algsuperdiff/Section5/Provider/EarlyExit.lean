# The canonical chain length and the Chernoff budget

The hit--exit bridge asks for a chain length below the usable trace count of a
good cube.  This file fixes the canonical choice — the usable count, after one
reserved site, divided by the overlap multiplicity — and verifies its counting
condition.  It also carries the deterministic Chernoff calculation that turns a
contraction bounded by `exp (-kappa)` together with a budget
`lam * t + b ≤ kappa * N` into the decay `exp (-b)`.
