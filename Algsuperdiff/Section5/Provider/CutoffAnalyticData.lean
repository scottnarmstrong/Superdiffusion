# The whole-space analytic datum of the coefficient cutoff

The whole-space process is built from a coefficient field of the form `a = ν I + k` with `ν > 0`
and `k` continuous and skew of arbitrary size; that structure is packaged as
`WholeSpaceAnalyticData`.  The coefficient cutoff `a_m = ν I + k_m` of the shell decomposition has
exactly that shape: its symmetric part is `ν I` at every point, by the skewness of every shell,
and each entry of `k_m` is continuous, being a locally uniform limit of finite sums of continuous
shells on the convergent sample carrier.

This file records the resulting whole-space analytic datum, whose coefficient field is
the cutoff field itself.  It carries no small-contrast or ellipticity-upper data: those are
separate structures, supplied where the analytic estimates are run.

## Main definitions


## Main results

* `continuous_coefficientCutoff` — the cutoff field is continuous.
* `cutoffWholeSpaceAnalyticData_a` — its coefficient field is the cutoff field.

/-- **The coefficient cutoff is a continuous field.**  Each entry of the lower-infinite shell sum
is a locally uniform limit of finite sums of continuous shells on the convergent sample carrier,
so the cutoff field is continuous and, with the constant molecular part added, so is `a_m`. -/
